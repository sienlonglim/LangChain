What are they used for? Database isolation allows a transaction to execute as if there are no other concurrently running transactions. The diagram below illustrates four isolation levels. 🔹Serializalble: This is the highest isolation level. Concurrent transactions are guaranteed to be executed in sequence. 🔹Repeatable Read: Data read during the transaction stays the same as the transaction starts. 🔹Read Committed: Data modification can only be read after the transaction is committed. 4🔹Read Uncommitted: The data modification can be read by other transactions before a transaction is committed. The isolation is guaranteed by MVCC (Multi-Version Consistency Control) and locks. The diagram below takes Repeatable Read as an example to demonstrate how MVCC works: There are two hidden columns for each row: transaction_id and roll_pointer. When transaction A starts, a new Read View with transaction_id=201 is created. Shortly afterward, transaction B starts, and a new Read View with transaction_id=202 is created. Now transaction A modifies the balance to 200, a new row of the log is created, and the roll_pointer points to the old row. Before transaction A commits, transaction B reads the balance data. Transaction B finds that transaction_id 201 is not committed, it reads the next committed record(transaction_id=200). Even when transaction A commits, transaction B still reads data based on the Read View created when transaction B starts. So transaction B always reads the data with balance=100.

The diagram below illustrates the differences between IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). For a non-cloud application, we own and manage all the hardware and software. We say the application is on-premises. With cloud computing, cloud service vendors provide three kinds of models for us to use: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. 𝐈𝐚𝐚𝐒 provides us access to cloud vendors\\' infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networking. We pay for the infrastructure service and install and manage supporting software on it for our application. 𝐏𝐚𝐚𝐒 goes further. It provides a platform with a variety of middleware, frameworks, and tools to build our application. We only focus on application development and data. 𝐒𝐚𝐚𝐒 enables the application to run in the cloud. We pay a monthly or annual fee to use the SaaS product. Over to you: which IaaS/PaaS/SaaS products have you used? How do you decide which architecture to use? Image Source: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/iaas-paas-saas 6Most popular programming languages Programming languages come and go. Some stand the test of time. Some already are shooting stars and some are rising rapidly on the horizon. I draw a diagram by putting the top 38 most commonly used programming languages in one place, sorted by year. Data source: StackOverflow survey. 1 JavaScript 2 HTML/CSS 3 Python 4 SQL 5 Java 6 Node 7 TypeScript 8 C 9 Bash/Shell 10 C 11 PHP 712 C 13 PowerShell 14 Go 15 Kotlin 16 Rust 17 Ruby 18 Dart 19 Assembly 20 Swift 21 R 22 VBA 23 Matlab 24 Groovy 25 Objective-C 26 Scala 27 Perl 28 Haskell 29 Delphi 30 Clojure 31 Elixir 32 LISP 33 Julia 34 F 35 Erlang 36 APL 37 Crystal 38 COBOL Over to you: what’s the first programming language you learned? And what are the other languages you learned over the years? 8What is the future of online payments? I don’t know the answer, but I do know one of the candidates is the blockchain. As a fan of technology, I always seek new solutions to old challenges. A book that explains a lot about an emerging payment system is ‘Mastering Bitcoin’ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. I want to share my discovery of this book with you because it explains very clearly bitcoin and its underlying blockchain. This book makes me rethink how to renovate payment systems. Here are the takeaways: 1. The bitcoin wallet balance is calculated on the fly, while the traditional wallet balance is stored in the database. You can check chapter 12 of System Design Interview Volume 2, on how to implement a traditional wallet (https://amzn.to/34G2vmC). 92. The golden source of truth for bitcoin is the blockchain, which is also the journal. It’s the same if we use Event Sourcing architecture to build a traditional wallet, although there are other options. 3. There is a small virtual machine for bitcoin - and also Ethereum. The virtual machine defines a set of bytecodes to do basic tasks such as validation. Over to you: if Elon Musk set up a base on planet Mars, what payment solution will you recommend? 10What is SSO (Single Sign-On)? A friend recently went through the irksome experience of being signed out from a number of websites they use daily. This event will be familiar to millions of web users, and it is a tedious process to fix. It can involve trying to remember multiple long-forgotten passwords, or typing in the names of pets from childhood to answer security questions. SSO removes this inconvenience and makes life online better. But how does it work? Basically, Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication scheme. It allows a user to log in to different systems using a single ID. The diagram below illustrates how SSO works. Step 1: A user visits Gmail, or any email service. Gmail finds the user is not logged in and so redirects them to the SSO authentication server, which also finds the user is not logged in. As a result, the user 11is redirected to the SSO login page, where they enter their login credentials. Steps 2-3: The SSO authentication server validates the credentials, creates the global session for the user, and creates a token. Steps 4-7: Gmail validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the Gmail system, and returns “valid.” Gmail returns the protected resource to the user. Step 8: From Gmail, the user navigates to another Google-owned website, for example, YouTube. Steps 9-10: YouTube finds the user is not logged in, and then requests authentication. The SSO authentication server finds the user is already logged in and returns the token. Step 11-14: YouTube validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the YouTube system, and returns “valid.” YouTube returns the protected resource to the user. The process is complete and the user gets back access to their account. Over to you: Question 1: have you implemented SSO in your projects? What is the most difficult part? Question 2: what’s your favorite sign-in method and why? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 12How to store passwords safely in the database? Let’s take a look. 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 🔹 Storing passwords in plain text is not a good idea because anyone with internal access can see them. 🔹 Storing password hashes directly is not sufficient because it is pruned to precomputation attacks, such as rainbow tables. 🔹 To mitigate precomputation attacks, we salt the passwords. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭? According to OWASP guidelines, “a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process”. 13𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭? 1⃣ A salt is not meant to be secret and it can be stored in plain text in the database. It is used to ensure the hash result is unique to each password. 2⃣ The password can be stored in the database using the following format: 𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘩( 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 + 𝘴𝘢𝘭𝘵). 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝? To validate a password, it can go through the following process: 1⃣ A client enters the password. 2⃣ The system fetches the corresponding salt from the database. 143⃣ The system appends the salt to the password and hashes it. Let’s call the hashed value H1. 4⃣ The system compares H1 and H2, where H2 is the hash stored in the database. If they are the same, the password is valid. Over to you: what other mechanisms can we use to ensure password safety? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 15How does HTTPS work? Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP.) HTTPS transmits encrypted data using Transport Layer Security (TLS.) If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code. How is the data encrypted and decrypted? Step 1 - The client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection. Step 2 - The client sends a “client hello” to the server. The message contains a set of necessary encryption algorithms (cipher suites) and the latest TLS version it can support. The server responds with a “server hello” so the browser knows whether it can support the algorithms and TLS version. 16The server then sends the SSL certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc. The client validates the certificate. Step 3 - After validating the SSL certificate, the client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key. The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key. Step 4 - Now that both the client and the server hold the same session key (symmetric encryption), the encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel. Why does HTTPS switch to symmetric encryption during data transmission? There are two main reasons: 1. Security: The asymmetric encryption goes only one way. This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key. 2. Server resources: The asymmetric encryption adds quite a lot of mathematical overhead. It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions. Over to you: how much performance overhead does HTTPS add, compared to HTTP? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 17How to learn design patterns? Besides reading a lot of well-written code, a good book guides us like a good teacher. 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬, second edition, is the one I would recommend. When I began my journey in software engineering, I found it hard to understand the classic textbook, 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬, by the Gang of Four. Luckily, I discovered Head First Design Patterns in the school library. This book solved a lot of puzzles for me. When I went back to the Design Patterns book, everything looked familiar and more understandable. Last year, I bought the second edition of Head First Design Patterns and read through it. Here are a few things I like about the book: 18🔹 This book solves the challenge of software’s abstract, “invisible” nature. Software is difficult to build because we cannot see its architecture; its details are embedded in the code and binary files. It is even harder to understand software design patterns because these are higher-level abstractions of the software. The book fixes this by using visualization. There are lots of diagrams, arrows, and comments on almost every page. If I do not understand the text, it’s no problem. The diagrams explain things very well. 🔹 We all have questions we are afraid to ask when we first learn a new skill. Maybe we think it’s an easy one. This book is good at tackling design patterns from the student’s point of view. It guides us by asking our questions and clearly answering them. There is a Guru in the book and there’s also a Student. Over to you: which book helped you understand a challenging topic? Why do you like it? 19A visual guide on how to choose the right Database Picking a database is a long-term commitment so the decision shouldn’t be made lightly. The important thing to keep in mind is to choose the right database for the right job. 20Data can be structured (SQL table schema), semi-structured (JSON, XML, etc.), and unstructured (Blob). Common database categories include: 🔹 Relational 🔹 Columnar 🔹 Key-value 🔹 In-memory 🔹 Wide column 🔹 Time Series 🔹 Immutable ledger 🔹Geospatial 🔹Graph 🔹Document 🔹Text search 🔹Blob Thanks, Satish Chandra Gupta Over to you - Which database have you used for which workload? 21Do you know how to generate globally unique IDs? In this post, we will explore common requirements for IDs that are used in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Requirements: 🔹Globally unique 🔹Roughly sorted by time 🔹Numerical values only 🔹64 bits 🔹Highly scalable, low latency 22The implementation details of the algorithms can be found online so we will not go into detail here.

This post is a summary of a tech talk given by Twitter in 2013. Let’s take a look. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐓𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐭: 1⃣ A tweet comes in through the Write API. 2⃣ The Write API routes the request to the Fanout service. 3⃣ The Fanout service does a lot of processing and stores them in the Redis cache. 244⃣ The Timeline service is used to find the Redis server that has the home timeline on it. 5⃣ A user pulls their home timeline through the Timeline service. 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 & 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 🔹 Ingester: annotates and tokenizes Tweets so the data can be indexed. 🔹 Earlybird: stores search index. 🔹 Blender: creates the search and discovery timelines. 𝐏𝐮𝐬𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞 🔹HTTP push 🔹Mobile push Disclaimer: This article is based on the tech talk given by Twitter in 2013 (https://bit.ly/3vNfjRp).

Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 25What is the difference between Process and Thread? To better understand this question, let’s first take a look at what is a Program. A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 is an executable file containing a set of instructions and passively stored on disk. One program can have multiple processes. For example, the Chrome browser creates a different process for every single tab. A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 means a program is in execution. When a program is loaded into the memory and becomes active, the program becomes a process. The process requires some essential resources such as registers, program counter, and stack. 26A 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 is the smallest unit of execution within a process. The following process explains the relationship between program, process, and thread. 1. The program contains a set of instructions. 2. The program is loaded into memory. It becomes one or more running processes. 3. When a process starts, it is assigned memory and resources. A process can have one or more threads. For example, in the Microsoft Word app, a thread might be responsible for spelling checking and the other thread for inserting text into the doc. Main differences between process and thread: 🔹 Processes are usually independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process. 🔹 Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory. 🔹 A process is a heavyweight operation.

The diagram below illustrates the common ones. 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 In this model, we deploy new changes to multiple services simultaneously. This approach is easy to implement. But since all the services are upgraded at the same time, it is hard to manage and test dependencies. It’s also hard to rollback safely. 30𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞-𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 With blue-green deployment, we have two identical environments: one is staging (blue) and the other is production (green). The staging environment is one version ahead of production. Once testing is done in the staging environment, user traffic is switched to the staging environment, and the staging becomes the production. This deployment strategy is simple to perform rollback, but having two identical production quality environments could be expensive. 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 A canary deployment upgrades services gradually, each time to a subset of users. It is cheaper than blue-green deployment and easy to perform rollback. However, since there is no staging environment, we have to test on production. This process is more complicated because we need to monitor the canary while gradually migrating more and more users away from the old version. 𝐀/𝐁 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭 In the A/B test, different versions of services run in production simultaneously. Each version runs an “experiment” for a subset of users. A/B test is a cheap method to test new features in production. We need to control the deployment process in case some features are pushed to users by accident. Over to you - Which deployment strategy have you used? Did you witness any deployment-related outages in production and why did they happen? 31Flowchart of how slack decides to send a notification It is a great example of why a simple feature may take much longer to develop than many people think. When we have a great design, users may not notice the complexity because it feels like the feature is just working as intended. What’s your takeaway from this diagram?

When we open web API access to users, we need to make sure each API call is authenticated. This means the user must be who they claim to be. In this post, we explore two common ways: 1. Token based authentication 2. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) authentication The diagram below illustrates how they work. 35𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 Step 1 - the user enters their password into the client, and the client sends the password to the Authentication Server. 36Step 2 - the Authentication Server authenticates the credentials and generates a token with an expiry time. Steps 3 and 4 - now the client can send requests to access server resources with the token in the HTTP header. This access is valid until the token expires. 𝐇𝐌𝐀𝐂 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 This mechanism generates a Message Authentication Code (signature) by using a hash function (SHA256 or MD5). Steps 1 and 2 - the server generates two keys, one is Public APP ID (public key) and the other one is API Key (private key). Step 3 - we now generate a HMAC signature on the client side (hmac A). This signature is generated with a set of attributes listed in the diagram. Step 4 - the client sends requests to access server resources with hmac A in the HTTP header. Step 5 - the server receives the request which contains the request data and the authentication header. It extracts the necessary attributes from the request and uses the API key that’s stored on the server side to generate a signature (hmac B.) Steps 6 and 7 - the server compares hmac A (generated on the client side) and hmac B (generated on the server side). If they are matched, the requested resource will be returned to the client. Question - How does HMAC authentication ensure data integrity? Why do we include “request timestamp” in HMAC signature generation? — Check out our bestselling system design books.

The diagram below illustrates the collaboration of microservices. Choreography is like having a choreographer set all the rules. Then the dancers on stage (the microservices) interact according to them. Service choreography describes this exchange of messages and the rules by which the microservices interact. Orchestration is different. The orchestrator acts as a center of authority. It is responsible for invoking and combining the services. It 38describes the interactions between all the participating services. It is just like a conductor leading the musicians in a musical symphony. The orchestration pattern also includes the transaction management among different services. The benefits of orchestration: 1. Reliability - orchestration has built-in transaction management and error handling, while choreography is point-to-point communications and the fault tolerance scenarios are much more complicated. 2. Scalability - when adding a new service into orchestration, only the orchestrator needs to modify the interaction rules, while in choreography all the interacting services need to be modified. Some limitations of orchestration: 1. Performance - all the services talk via a centralized orchestrator, so latency is higher than it is with choreography. Also, the throughput is bound to the capacity of the orchestrator. 2. Single point of failure - if the orchestrator goes down, no services can talk to each other. To mitigate this, the orchestrator must be highly available. Real-world use case: Netflix Conductor is a microservice orchestrator and you can read more details on the orchestrator design.

The diagram below illustrates the layered architecture of virtualization and containerization. “Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system” [1]. “Containerization is the packaging together of software code with all its necessary components like libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies so that they are isolated in their own \"container\" [2]. The major differences are: 🔹 In virtualization, the hypervisor creates an abstraction layer over hardware, so that multiple operating systems can run alongside each other. This technique is considered to be the first generation of cloud computing. 🔹Containerization is considered to be a lightweight version of virtualization, which virtualizes the operating system instead of hardware. Without the hypervisor, the containers enjoy faster resource provisioning. All the resources (including code, dependencies) that are 40needed to run the application or microservice are packaged together, so that the applications can run anywhere. Question: how much performance differences have you observed in production between virtualization, containerization, and bare-metal?

The diagram below illustrates the detailed comparison of AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. 42The common parts of the solutions: 1. Data ingestion of structured or unstructured data. 2. Raw data storage. 3. Data processing, including filtering, transformation, normalization, etc. 4. Data warehouse, including key-value storage, relational database, OLAP database, etc. 5. Presentation layer with dashboards and real-time notifications. It is interesting to see different cloud vendors have different names for the same type of products. For example, the first step and the last step both use the serverless product. The product is called “lambda” in AWS, and “function” in Azure and Google Cloud. Question - which products have you used in production? What kind of application did you use it for? Source: S.C. Gupta’s post 43How to avoid crawling duplicate URLs at Google scale? Option 1: Use a Set data structure to check if a URL already exists or not. Set is fast, but it is not space-efficient. Option 2: Store URLs in a database and check if a new URL is in the database. This can work but the load to the database will be very high. Option 3: 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫. This option is preferred. Bloom filter was proposed by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970. It is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 🔹 false: the element is definitely not in the set. 🔹 true: the element is probably in the set. False-positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not. The diagram below illustrates how the Bloom filter works. The basic data structure for the Bloom filter is Bit Vector. Each bit represents a hashed value. 44Step 1: To add an element to the bloom filter, we feed it to 3 different hash functions (A, B, and C) and set the bits at the resulting positions. Note that both “www.myweb1.com” and “www.myweb2.com” mark the same bit with 1 at index 5. False positives are possible because a bit might be set by another element. Step 2: When testing the existence of a URL string, the same hash functions A, B, and C are applied to the URL string. If all three bits are 451, then the URL may exist in the dataset; if any of the bits is 0, then the URL definitely does not exist in the dataset. Hash function choices are important. They must be uniformly distributed and fast. For example, RedisBloom and Apache Spark use murmur, and InfluxDB uses xxhash. Question - In our example, we used three hash functions. How many hash functions should we use in reality? What are the trade-offs? — Check out our bestselling system design books.

Bits are stored into cells, which are made of floating-gate transistors. SSDs are made entirely of electronic components, there are no moving or mechanical parts like in hard drives (HDD)” [2]. The diagram below illustrates the SSD architecture. 47Step 1: “Commands come from the user through the host interface” [2]. The interface can be Serial ATA (SATA) or PCI Express (PCIe). Step 2: “The processor in the SSD controller takes the commands and passes them to the flash controller” [2]. Step 3: “SSDs also have embedded RAM memory, generally for caching purposes and to store mapping information” [2]. Step 4: “The packages of NAND flash memory are organized in gangs, over multiple channels” [2]. The second diagram illustrates how the logical and physical pages are mapped, and why this architecture is fast. SSD controller operates multiple FLASH particles in parallel, greatly improving the underlying bandwidth. When we need to write more than one page, the SSD controller can write them in parallel [3], whereas the HDD has a single head and it can only read from one head at a time. Every time a HOST Page is written, the SSD controller finds a Physical Page to write the data and this mapping is recorded. With this mapping, the next time HOST reads a HOST Page, the SSD knows where to read the data from FLASH [3]. Question - What are the main differences between SSD and HDD? If you are interested in the architecture, I recommend reading Coding for SSDs by Emmanuel Goossaert in reference [2].

About 10 years ago, I witnessed the most impactful UI bugs in my career. It was 9PM on a Friday. I was on the team responsible for one of the largest social games at the time. It had about 30 million DAU. I just so happened to glance at the operational dashboard before shutting down for the night. Every line on the dashboard was at zero. At that very moment, I got a phone call from my boss. He said the entire game was down. Firefighting mode. Full on. Everything had shut down. Every single instance on AWS was terminated. HA proxy instances, PHP web servers, MySQL databases, Memcache nodes, everything. It took 50 people 10 hours to bring everything back up. It was quite a feat. That in itself is a story for another day. We used a cloud management software vendor to manage our AWS deployment. This was before Infrastructure as Code was a thing. There was no Terraform. It was so early in cloud computing and we were so big that AWS required an advanced warning before we scaled up. What had gone wrong? The software vendor had introduced a bug that week in their confirmation dialog flow. When terminating a subset of nodes in the UI, it would correctly show in the confirmation dialog box the list of nodes to be terminated, but under the hood, it terminated everything. Shortly before 9PM that fateful evening, one of our poor SREs fulfilled our routine request and terminated an unused Memcache pool. I could only imagine the horror and the phone conversation that ensured. 49What kind of code structure could allow this disastrous bug to slip through? We could only guess. We never received a full explanation. What are some of the most impactful software bugs you encountered in your career? 50AWS Lambda behind the scenes Serverless is one of the hottest topics in cloud services. How does AWS Lambda work behind the scenes? Lambda is a 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs functions in response to events. 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐕𝐌 Firecracker is the engine powering all of the Lambda functions [1]. It is a virtualization technology developed at Amazon and written in Rust. The diagram below illustrates the isolation model for AWS Lambda Workers. 51Lambda functions run within a sandbox, which provides a minimal Linux userland, some common libraries and utilities. It creates the Execution environment (worker) on EC2 instances. How are lambdas initiated and invoked? There are two ways. 𝐒𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 Step1: \"The Worker Manager communicates with a Placement Service which is responsible to place a workload on a location for the given host (it’s provisioning the sandbox) and returns that to the Worker Manager\" [2]. Step 2: \"The Worker Manager can then call 𝘐𝘯𝘪𝘵 to initialize the function for execution by downloading the Lambda package from S3 and setting up the Lambda runtime\" [2] Step 3: The Frontend Worker is now able to call 𝘐𝘯𝘷𝘰𝘬𝘦 [2]. 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 Step 1: The Application Load Balancer forwards the invocation to an available Frontend which places the event onto an internal queue(SQS). Step 2: There is \"a set of pollers assigned to this internal queue which are responsible for polling it and moving the event onto a Frontend synchronously. After it’s been placed onto the Frontend it follows the synchronous invocation call pattern which we covered earlier\" [2]. Question: Can you think of any use cases for AWS Lambda?

What problem does each generation of HTTP solve? The diagram below illustrates the key features. 🔹HTTP 1.0 was finalized and fully documented in 1996. Every request to the same server requires a separate TCP connection. 🔹HTTP 1.1 was published in 1997. A TCP connection can be left open for reuse (persistent connection), but it doesn’t solve the HOL (head-of-line) blocking issue. HOL blocking - when the number of allowed parallel requests in the browser is used up, subsequent requests need to wait for the former ones to complete. 53🔹HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015. It addresses HOL issue through request multiplexing, which eliminates HOL blocking at the application layer, but HOL still exists at the transport (TCP) layer. As you can see in the diagram, HTTP 2.0 introduced the concept of HTTP “streams”: an abstraction that allows multiplexing different HTTP exchanges onto the same TCP connection. Each stream doesn’t need to be sent in order. 🔹HTTP 3.0 first draft was published in 2020. It is the proposed successor to HTTP 2.0. It uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol, thus removing HOL blocking in the transport layer. QUIC is based on UDP. It introduces streams as first-class citizens at the transport layer. QUIC streams share the same QUIC connection, so no additional handshakes and slow starts are required to create new ones, but QUIC streams are delivered independently such that in most cases packet loss affecting one stream doesn\\'t affect others.

The diagram below illustrates the evolution of a simplified eCommerce website. It goes from a monolithic design on one single server, to a service-oriented/microservice architecture. 5556Suppose we have two services: inventory service (handles product descriptions and inventory management) and user service (handles user information, registration, login, etc.). Step 1 - With the growth of the user base, one single application server cannot handle the traffic anymore. We put the application server and the database server into two separate servers. Step 2 - The business continues to grow, and a single application server is no longer enough. So we deploy a cluster of application servers. Step 3 - Now the incoming requests have to be routed to multiple application servers, how can we ensure each application server gets an even load? The load balancer handles this nicely. Step 4 - With the business continuing to grow, the database might become the bottleneck. To mitigate this, we separate reads and writes in a way that frequent read queries go to read replicas. With this setup, the throughput for the database writes can be greatly increased. Step 5 - Suppose the business continues to grow. One single database cannot handle the load on both the inventory table and user table. We have a few options: 1. Vertical partition. Adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to the database server. It has a hard limit. 2. Horizontal partition by adding more database servers. 3. Adding a caching layer to offload read requests. Step 6 - Now we can modularize the functions into different services. The architecture becomes service-oriented / microservice.

Kafka achieves low latency message delivery through Sequential I/O and Zero Copy Principle. The same techniques are commonly used in many other messaging/streaming platforms. The diagram below illustrates how the data is transmitted between producer and consumer, and what zero-copy means. 🔹Step 1.1 - 1.3: Producer writes data to the disk 60🔹Step 2: Consumer reads data without zero-copy 2.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache 2.2 The data is copied from OS cache to Kafka application 2.3 Kafka application copies the data into the socket buffer 2.4 The data is copied from socket buffer to network card 2.5 The network card sends data out to the consumer 🔹Step 3: Consumer reads data with zero-copy 3.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache 3.2 OS cache directly copies the data to the network card via sendfile() command 3.3 The network card sends data out to the consumer Zero copy is a shortcut to save the multiple data copies between application context and kernel context.

The advantages on data structures make Redis a good choice for: 🔹 Recording the number of clicks and comments for each post (hash) 🔹 Sorting the commented user list and deduping the users (zset) 🔹 Caching user behavior history and filtering malicious behaviors (zset, hash) 🔹 Storing boolean information of extremely large data into small space. For example, login status, membership status. (bitmap) 64Optimistic locking Optimistic locking, also referred to as optimistic concurrency control, allows multiple concurrent users to attempt to update the same resource. There are two common ways to implement optimistic locking: version number and timestamp. Version number is generally considered to be a better option because the server clock can be inaccurate over time. We explain how optimistic locking works with version number. The diagram below shows a successful case and a failure case. 1. A new column called “version” is added to the database table. 2. Before a user modifies a database row, the application reads the version number of the row. 3. When the user updates the row, the application increases the version number by 1 and writes it back to the database. 4. A database validation check is put in place; the next version number should exceed the current version number by 1. The transaction aborts if the validation fails and the user tries again from step 2. 65Optimistic locking is usually faster than pessimistic locking because we do not lock the database. However, the performance of optimistic locking drops dramatically when concurrency is high. To understand why, consider the case when many clients try to reserve a hotel room at the same time. Because there is no limit on how many clients can read the available room count, all of them read back the same available room count and the current version number. When different clients make reservations and write back the results to the database, only one of them will succeed, and the rest of the clients receive a version check failure message. These clients have to retry. In the subsequent round of retries, there is only one successful client again, and the rest have to retry. Although the end result is correct, repeated retries cause a very unpleasant user experience. Question: what are the possible ways of solving race conditions? 66Tradeoff between latency and consistency Understanding the 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 is very important not only in system design interviews but also designing real-world systems. When we talk about data replication, there is a fundamental tradeoff between 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 and 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. It is illustrated by the diagram below. 67Cache miss attack Caching is awesome but it doesn’t come without a cost, just like many things in life. One of the issues is 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐬 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤. Correct me if this is not the right term. It refers to the scenario where data to fetch doesn\\'t exist in the database and the data isn’t cached either. So every request hits the database eventually, defeating the purpose of using a cache. If a malicious user initiates lots of queries with such keys, the database can easily be overloaded. The diagram below illustrates the process. Two approaches are commonly used to solve this problem: 68🔹Cache keys with null value. Set a short TTL (Time to Live) for keys with null value. 🔹Using Bloom filter. A Bloom filter is a data structure that can rapidly tell us whether an element is present in a set or not. If the key exists, the request first goes to the cache and then queries the database if needed. If the key doesn\\'t exist in the data set, it means the key doesn’t exist in the cache/database. In this case, the query will not hit the cache or database layer. — Check out our bestselling system design books.

Before we answer this question, let\\'s take a look at why we need to optimize this process. Some files might be larger than a few GBs. It is possible to upload such a large object file directly, but it could take a long time. If the network connection fails in the middle of the upload, we have to start over. A better solution is to slice a large object into smaller parts and upload them independently. After all the parts are uploaded, the object store re-assembles the object from the parts. This process is called 𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝. The diagram below illustrates how multipart upload works: 741. The client calls the object storage to initiate a multipart upload. 2. The data store returns an uploadID, which uniquely identifies the upload. 3. The client splits the large file into small objects and starts uploading. Let’s assume the size of the file is 1.6GB and the client splits it into 8 parts, so each part is 200 MB in size. The client uploads the first part to the data store together with the uploadID it received in step 2. 4. When a part is uploaded, the data store returns an ETag, which is essentially the md5 checksum of that part. It is used to verify multipart uploads. 5. After all parts are uploaded, the client sends a complete multipart upload request, which includes the uploadID, part numbers, and ETags. 6. The data store reassembles the object from its parts based on the part number. Since the object is really large, this process may take a few minutes. After reassembly is complete, it returns a success message to the client. — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 75Why is Redis so Fast?

What role does it play in cross-border payments? You can find answers to those questions in this post. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is the main secure 𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 that links the world’s banks. The Belgium-based system is run by its member banks and handles millions of payment messages per day. The diagram below illustrates how payment messages are transmitted from Bank A (in New York) to Bank B (in London). Step 1: Bank A sends a message with transfer details to Regional Processor A in New York. The destination is Bank B. 77Step 2: Regional processor validates the format and sends it to Slice Processor A. The Regional Processor is responsible for input message validation and output message queuing. The Slice Processor is responsible for storing and routing messages safely. Step 3: Slice Processor A stores the message. Step 4: Slice Processor A informs Regional Processor A the message is stored. Step 5: Regional Processor A sends ACK/NAK to Bank A. ACK means a message will be sent to Bank B. NAK means the message will NOT be sent to Bank B. Step 6: Slice Processor A sends the message to Regional Processor B in London. Step 7: Regional Processor B stores the message temporarily. Step 8: Regional Processor B assigns a unique ID MON (Message Output Number) to the message and sends it to Slice Processor B Step 9: Slice Processor B validates MON. Step 10: Slice Processor B authorizes Regional Processor B to send the message to Bank B. Step 11: Regional Processor B sends the message to Bank B. Step 12: Bank B receives the message and stores it. Step 13: Bank B sends UAK/UNK to Regional Processor B. UAK (user positive acknowledgment) means Bank B received the message without error; UNK (user negative acknowledgment) means Bank B received checksum failure. Step 14: Regional Processor B creates a report based on Bank B’s response, and sends it to Slice Processor B. 78Step 15: Slice Processor B stores the report. Step 16 - 17: Slice Processor B sends a copy of the report to Slice Processor A. Slice Processor A stores the report. — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 79At-most once, at-least once, and exactly once In modern architecture, systems are broken up into small and independent building blocks with well-defined interfaces between them. Message queues provide communication and coordination for those building blocks. Today, let’s discuss different delivery semantics: at-most once, at-least once, and exactly once. 𝐀𝐭-𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 As the name suggests, at-most once means a message will be delivered not more than once. Messages may be lost but are not redelivered. This is how at-most once delivery works at the high level. Use cases: It is suitable for use cases like monitoring metrics, where a small amount of data loss is acceptable. 𝐀𝐭-𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 With this data delivery semantic, it’s acceptable to deliver a message more than once, but no message should be lost. Use cases: With at-least once, messages won’t be lost but the same message might be delivered multiple times. While not ideal from a user perspective, at-least once delivery semantics are usually good enough for use cases where data duplication is not a big issue or deduplication 80is possible on the consumer side. For example, with a unique key in each message, a message can be rejected when writing duplicate data to the database. 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 Exactly once is the most difficult delivery semantic to implement. It is friendly to users, but it has a high cost for the system’s performance and complexity. Use cases: Financial-related use cases (payment, trading, accounting, etc.). Exactly once is especially important when duplication is not acceptable and the downstream service or third party doesn’t support idempotency. Question: what is the difference between message queues vs event streaming platforms such as Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc? 81Vertical partitioning and Horizontal partitioning In many large-scale applications, data is divided into partitions that can be accessed separately. There are two typical strategies for partitioning data. 🔹 Vertical partitioning: it means some columns are moved to new tables. Each table contains the same number of rows but fewer columns (see diagram below). 🔹 Horizontal partitioning (often called sharding): it divides a table into multiple smaller tables. Each table is a separate data store, and it contains the same number of columns, but fewer rows (see diagram below). 82Horizontal partitioning is widely used so let’s take a closer look. 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦 Routing algorithm decides which partition (shard) stores the data. 🔹 Range-based sharding. This algorithm uses ordered columns, such as integers, longs, timestamps, to separate the rows. For example, the diagram below uses the User ID column for range partition: User IDs 1 and 2 are in shard 1, User IDs 3 and 4 are in shard 2. 🔹 Hash-based sharding. This algorithm applies a hash function to one column or several columns to decide which row goes to which table. For example, the diagram below uses 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐃 𝐦𝐨𝐝 2 as a hash function. User IDs 1 and 3 are in shard 1, User IDs 2 and 4 are in shard 2. 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 🔹 Facilitate horizontal scaling. Sharding facilitates the possibility of adding more machines to spread out the load. 🔹 Shorten response time. By sharding one table into multiple tables, queries go over fewer rows, and results are returned much more quickly. 𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬 🔹 The order by the operation is more complicated. Usually, we need to fetch data from different shards and sort the data in the application\\'s code. 🔹 Uneven distribution. Some shards may contain more data than others (this is also called the hotspot). This topic is very big and I’m sure I missed a lot of important details. What else do you think is important for data partitioning? 83CDN A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed servers (also called edge servers) which provide fast delivery of static and dynamic content. Let’s take a look at how it works. Suppose Bob who lives in New York wants to visit an eCommerce website that is deployed in London. If the request goes to servers located in London, the response will be quite slow. So we deploy CDN servers close to where Bob lives, and the content will be loaded from the nearby CDN server. The diagram below illustrates the process: 1. Bob types in www.myshop.com in the browser. The browser looks up the domain name in the local DNS cache. 842. If the domain name does not exist in the local DNS cache, the browser goes to the DNS resolver to resolve the name. The DNS resolver usually sits in the Internet Service Provider (ISP). 3. The DNS resolver recursively resolves the domain name (see my previous post for details). Finally, it asks the authoritative name server to resolve the domain name. 4. If we don’t use CDN, the authoritative name server returns the IP address for www.myshop.com. But with CDN, the authoritative name server has an alias pointing to www.myshop.cdn.com (the domain name of the CDN server). 5. The DNS resolver asks the authoritative name server to resolve www.myshop.cdn.com. 6. The authoritative name server returns the domain name for the load balancer of CDN www.myshop.lb.com. 7. The DNS resolver asks the CDN load balancer to resolve www.myshop.lb.com. The load balancer chooses an optimal CDN edge server based on the user’s IP address, user’s ISP, the content requested, and the server load. 8. The CDN load balancer returns the CDN edge server’s IP address for www.myshop.lb.com. 9. Now we finally get the actual IP address to visit. The DNS resolver returns the IP address to the browser. 10. The browser visits the CDN edge server to load the content. There are two types of contents cached on the CDN servers: static contents and dynamic contents. The former contains static pages, pictures, and videos; the latter one includes results of edge computing. 11. If the edge CDN server cache doesn\\'t contain the content, it goes upward to the regional CDN server. If the content is still not found, it will go upward to the central CDN server, or even go to the origin - the 85London web server. This is called the CDN distribution network, where the servers are deployed geographically. Over to you: How do you prevent videos cached on CDN from being pirated? 86Erasure coding A really cool technique that’s commonly used in object storage such as S3 to improve durability is called 𝐄𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠. Let’s take a look at how it works. 87Erasure coding deals with data durability differently from replication. It chunks data into smaller pieces (placed on different servers) and creates parities for redundancy. In the event of failures, we can use chunk data and parities to reconstruct the data. Let’s take a look at a concrete example (4 + 2 erasure coding) as shown in Figure 1. 1⃣ Data is broken up into four even-sized data chunks d1, d2, d3, and d4. 2⃣ The mathematical formula is used to calculate the parities p1 and p2. To give a much simplified example, p1 = d1 + 2*d2 - d3 + 4*d4 and p2 = -d1 + 5*d2 + d3 - 3*d4. 3⃣ Data d3 and d4 are lost due to node crashes. 4⃣ The mathematical formula is used to reconstruct lost data d3 and d4, using the known values of d1, d2, p1, and p2. How much extra space does erasure coding need? For every two chunks of data, we need one parity block, so the storage overhead is 50% (Figure 2). While in 3-copy replication, the storage overhead is 200% (Figure 2). Does erasure coding increase data durability? Let’s assume a node has a 0.81% annual failure rate. According to the calculation done by Backblaze, erasure coding can achieve 11 nines durability vs 3-copy replication can achieve 6 nines durability. What other techniques do you think are important to improve the scalability and durability of an object store such as S3? 88Foreign exchange in payment Have you wondered what happens under the hood when you pay with USD online and the seller from Europe receives EUR (euro)? This process is called foreign exchange. Suppose Bob (the buyer) needs to pay 100 USD to Alice (the seller), and Alice can only receive EUR. The diagram below illustrates the process. 1. Bob sends 100 USD via a third-party payment provider. In our example, it is Paypal. The money is transferred from Bob’s bank account (Bank B) to Paypal’s account in Bank P1. 2. Paypal needs to convert USD to EUR. It leverages the foreign exchange provider (Bank E). Paypal sends 100 USD to its USD account in Bank E. 893. 100 USD is sold to Bank E’s funding pool. 4. Bank E’s funding pool provides 88 EUR in exchange for 100 USD. The money is put into Paypal’s EUR account in Bank E. 5. Paypal’s EUR account in Bank P2 receives 88 EUR. 6. 88 EUR is paid to Alice’s EUR account in Bank A. Now let’s take a close look at the foreign exchange (forex) market. It has 3 layers: 🔹 Retail market. Funding pools are parts of the retail market. To improve efficiency, Paypal usually buys a certain amount of foreign currencies in advance. 🔹 Wholesale market. The wholesale business is composed of investment banks, commercial banks, and foreign exchange providers. It usually handles accumulated orders from the retail market. 🔹 Top-level participants. They are multinational commercial banks that hold a large number of certificates of deposit from different countries. They exchange these certificates for foreign exchange trading. When Bank E’s funding pool needs more EUR, it goes upward to the wholesale market to sell USD and buy EUR. When the wholesale market accumulates enough orders, it goes upward to top-level participants. Steps 3.1-3.3 and 4.1-4.3 explain how it works. If you have any questions, please leave a comment. What foreign currency did you find difficult to exchange? And what company have you used for foreign currency exchange? 90Interview Question: Design S3 What happens when you upload a file to Amazon S3? Let’s design an S3 like object storage system. Before we dive into the design, let’s define some terms. 91𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭. A logical container for objects. The bucket name is globally unique. To upload data to S3, we must first create a bucket. 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭. An object is an individual piece of data we store in a bucket. It contains object data (also called payload) and metadata. Object data can be any sequence of bytes we want to store. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. An S3 object consists of (Figure 1): 🔹 Metadata. It is mutable and contains attributes such as ID, bucket name, object name, etc. 🔹 Object data. It is immutable and contains the actual data. In S3, an object resides in a bucket. The path looks like this: /bucket-to-share/script.txt. The bucket only has metadata. The object has metadata and the actual data. The diagram below (Figure 2) illustrates how file uploading works. In this example, we first create a bucket named “bucket-to-share” and then upload a file named “script.txt” to the bucket. 1. The client sends an HTTP PUT request to create a bucket named “bucket-to-share.” The request is forwarded to the API service. 2. The API service calls the Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure the user is authorized and has WRITE permission. 3. The API service calls the metadata store to create an entry with the bucket info in the metadata database. Once the entry is created, a success message is returned to the client. 4. After the bucket is created, the client sends an HTTP PUT request to create an object named “script.txt”. 5. The API service verifies the user’s identity and ensures the user has WRITE permission on the bucket. 926. Once validation succeeds, the API service sends the object data in the HTTP PUT payload to the data store. The data store persists the payload as an object and returns the UUID of the object. 7. The API service calls the metadata store to create a new entry in the metadata database. It contains important metadata such as the object_id (UUID), bucket_id (which bucket the object belongs to), object_name, etc. 93Block storage, file storage and object storage Yesterday, I posted the definitions of block storage, file storage, and object storage. Let’s continue the discussion and compare those 3 options. 94Block storage, file storage and object storage In this post, let’s review the storage systems in general. Storage systems fall into three broad categories: 🔹 Block storage 🔹 File storage 🔹 Object storage The diagram below illustrates the comparison of different storage systems. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 Block storage came first, in the 1960s. Common storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD) that are physically attached to servers are all considered as block storage. Block storage presents the raw blocks to the server as a volume. This is the most flexible and versatile form of storage. The server can format the raw blocks and use them as a file system, or it can hand control of those blocks to an application. Some applications like a database or a virtual machine engine manage these blocks directly in order to squeeze every drop of performance out of them. Block storage is not limited to physically attached storage. Block storage could be connected to a server over a high-speed network or over industry-standard connectivity protocols like Fibre Channel (FC) 95and iSCSI. Conceptually, the network-attached block storage still presents raw blocks. To the servers, it works the same as physically attached block storage. Whether to a network or physically attached, block storage is fully owned by a single server. It is not a shared resource. 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 File storage is built on top of block storage. It provides a higher-level abstraction to make it easier to handle files and directories. Data is stored as files under a hierarchical directory structure. File storage is the most common general-purpose storage solution. File storage could be made accessible by a large number of servers using common file-level network protocols like SMB/CIFS and NFS. The servers accessing file storage do not need to deal with the complexity of managing the blocks, formatting volume, etc. The simplicity of file storage makes it a great solution for sharing a large number of files and folders within an organization. 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 Object storage is new. It makes a very deliberate tradeoff to sacrifice performance for high durability, vast scale, and low cost. It targets relatively “cold” data and is mainly used for archival and backup. Object storage stores all data as objects in a flat structure. There is no hierarchical directory structure. Data access is normally provided via a RESTful API. It is relatively slow compared to other storage types. Most public cloud service providers have an object storage offering, such as AWS S3, Google block storage, and Azure blob storage. 96Domain Name System (DNS) lookup DNS acts as an address book. It translates human-readable domain names (google.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (142.251.46.238). To achieve better scalability, the DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical tree structure. There are 3 basic levels of DNS servers: 1. Root name server (.). It stores the IP addresses of Top Level Domain (TLD) name servers. There are 13 logical root name servers globally. 2. TLD name server. It stores the IP addresses of authoritative name servers. There are several types of TLD names. For example, generic TLD (.com, .org), country code TLD (.us), test TLD (.test). 3. Authoritative name server. It provides actual answers to the DNS query. You can register authoritative name servers with domain name registrar such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc. The diagram below illustrates how DNS lookup works under the hood: 1. google.com is typed into the browser, and the browser sends the domain name to the DNS resolver. 972. The resolver queries a DNS root name server. 3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a TLD DNS server. In this case, it is .com. 4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD. 5. The TLD server responds with the IP address of the domain’s name server, google.com (authoritative name server). 6. The DNS resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver. 7. The IP address for google.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver. 8. The DNS resolver responds to the web browser with the IP address (142.251.46.238) of the domain requested initially. DNS lookups on average take between 20-120 milliseconds to complete (according to YSlow). 98What happens when you type a URL into your browser? The diagram below illustrates the steps. 1. Bob enters a URL into the browser and hits Enter. In this example, the URL is composed of 4 parts: 🔹 scheme - 𝒉𝒕𝒕𝒑𝒔://. This tells the browser to send a connection to the server using HTTPS. 🔹 domain - 𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆.𝒄𝒐𝒎. This is the domain name of the site. 🔹 path - 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒕/𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒄. It is the path on the server to the requested resource: phone. 🔹 resource - 𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒏𝒆. It is the name of the resource Bob wants to visit. 2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain with a domain name system (DNS) lookup. To make the lookup process fast, data is cached at different layers: browser cache, OS cache, local network cache and ISP cache. 992.1 If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found (this will be covered in another post). 3. Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server. 4. The browser sends a HTTP request to the server. The request looks like this: 𝘎𝘌𝘛 /𝘱𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 𝘏𝘰𝘴𝘵: 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦.𝘤𝘰𝘮 5. The server processes the request and sends back the response. For a successful response (the status code is 200). The HTML response might look like this: 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 200 𝘖𝘒 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘦: 𝘚𝘶𝘯, 30 𝘑𝘢𝘯 2022 00:01:01 𝘎𝘔𝘛 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳: 𝘈𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵-𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦: 𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵/𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭; 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘵=𝘶𝘵𝘧-8 <!𝘋𝘖𝘊𝘛𝘠𝘗𝘌 𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭> <𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨=\"𝘦𝘯\"> 𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥 </𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭> 6. The browser renders the HTML content. 100AI Coding engine DeepMind says its new AI coding engine (AlphaCode) is as good as an average programmer. The AI bot participated in the 10 Codeforces coding competitions and was ranked 54.3%. It means its score exceeded half of the human contestants. If we look at its score for the last 6 months, AlphaCode ranks at 28%. The diagram below explains how the AI bot works: 1. Pre-train the transformer models on GitHub code. 2. Fine-tune the models on the relatively small competitive programming dataset. 3. At evaluation time, create a massive amount of solutions for each problem. 4. Filter, cluster and rerank the solutions to a small set of candidate programs (at most 10), and then submit for further assessments. 5. Run the candidate programs against the test cases, evaluate the performance, and choose the best one. 101Do you think AI bot will be better at Leetcode or competitive programming than software engineers five years from now? 102Read replica pattern There are two common ways to implement the read replica pattern: 1. Embed the routing logic in the application code (explained in the last post). 2. Use database middleware. We focus on option 2 here. The middleware provides transparent routing between the application and database servers. We can customize the routing logic based on difficult rules such as user, schema, statement, etc. The diagram below illustrates the setup: 1031. When Alice places an order on amazon, the request is sent to Order Service. 2. Order Service does not directly interact with the database. Instead, it sends database queries to the database middleware. 3. The database middleware routes writes to the primary database. Data is replicated to two replicas. 4. Alice views the order details (read). The request is sent through the middleware. 5. Alice views the recent order history (read). The request is sent through the middleware. The database middleware acts as a proxy between the application and databases. It uses standard MySQL network protocol for communication. Pros: - Simplified application code. The application doesn’t need to be aware of the database topology and manage access to the database directly. - Better compatibility. The middleware uses the MySQL network protocol. Any MySQL compatible client can connect to the middleware easily. This makes database migration easier. Cons: - Increased system complexity. A database middleware is a complex system. Since all database queries go through the middleware, it usually requires a high availability setup to avoid a single point of failure. - Additional middleware layer means additional network latency. Therefore, this layer requires excellent performance. 104Read replica pattern In this post, we talk about a simple yet commonly used database design pattern (setup): 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧. In this setup, all data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update are sent to the primary DB, and reads are sent to read replicas. The diagram below illustrates the setup: 1. When Alice places an order on amazon.com, the request is sent to Order Service. 2. Order Service creates a record about the order in the primary DB (write). Data is replicated to two replicas. 3. Alice views the order details. Data is served from a replica (read). 4. Alice views the recent order history. Data is served from a replica (read). There is one major problem in this setup: 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐚𝐠. 105Under certain circumstances (network delay, server overload, etc.), data in replicas might be seconds or even minutes behind. In this case, if Alice immediately checks the order status (query is served by the replica) after the order is placed, she might not see the order at all. This leaves Alice confused. In this case, we need “read-after-write” consistency. Possible solutions to mitigate this problem: 1⃣ Latency sensitive reads are sent to the primary database. 2⃣ Reads that immediately follow writes are routed to the primary database. 3⃣ A relational DB generally provides a way to check if a replica is caught up with the primary. If data is up to date, query the replica. Otherwise, fail the read request or read from the primary. 106Email receiving flow The following diagram demonstrates the email receiving flow. 1. Incoming emails arrive at the SMTP load balancer. 2. The load balancer distributes traffic among SMTP servers. Email acceptance policy can be configured and applied at the SMTP-connection level. For example, invalid emails are bounced to avoid unnecessary email processing. 3. If the attachment of an email is too large to put into the queue, we can put it into the attachment store (s3). 4. Emails are put in the incoming email queue. The queue decouples mail processing workers from SMTP servers so they can be scaled independently. Moreover, the queue serves as a buffer in case the email volume surges. 5. Mail processing workers are responsible for a lot of tasks, including filtering out spam mails, stopping viruses, etc. The following steps assume an email passed the validation. 6. The email is stored in the mail storage, cache, and object data store. 1077. If the receiver is currently online, the email is pushed to real-time servers. 8. Real-time servers are WebSocket servers that allow clients to receive new emails in real-time. 9. For offline users, emails are stored in the storage layer. When a user comes back online, the webmail client connects to web servers via RESTful API. 10. Web servers pull new emails from the storage layer and return them to the client. 108Email sending flow In this post, we will take a closer look at the email sending flow. 1. A user writes an email on webmail and presses the “send” button. The request is sent to the load balancer. 2. The load balancer makes sure it doesn’t exceed the rate limit and routes traffic to web servers. 3. Web servers are responsible for: - Basic email validation. Each incoming email is checked against pre-defined rules such as email size limit. - Checking if the domain of the recipient’s email address is the same as the sender. If it is the same, email data is inserted to storage, cache, and object store directly. The recipient can fetch the email directly via the RESTful API. There is no need to go to step 4. 4. Message queues. 1094.a. If basic email validation succeeds, the email data is passed to the outgoing queue. 4.b. If basic email validation fails, the email is put in the error queue. 5. SMTP outgoing workers pull events from the outgoing queue and make sure emails are spam and virus free. 6. The outgoing email is stored in the “Sent Folder” of the storage layer. 7. SMTP outgoing workers send the email to the recipient mail server. Each message in the outgoing queue contains all the metadata required to create an email. A distributed message queue is a critical component that allows asynchronous mail processing. By decoupling SMTP outgoing workers from the web servers, we can scale SMTP outgoing workers independently. We monitor the size of the outgoing queue very closely. If there are many emails stuck in the queue, we need to analyze the cause of the issue. Here are some possibilities: - The recipient’s mail server is unavailable. In this case, we need to retry sending the email at a later time. Exponential backoff might be a good retry strategy. - Not enough consumers to send emails. In this case, we may need more consumers to reduce the processing time. 110Interview Question: Design Gmail One picture is worth more than a thousand words. In this post, we will take a look at what happens when Alice sends an email to Bob. 1. Alice logs in to her Outlook client, composes an email, and presses “send”. The email is sent to the Outlook mail server. The communication protocol between the Outlook client and mail server is SMTP. 2. Outlook mail server queries the DNS (not shown in the diagram) to find the address of the recipient’s SMTP server. In this case, it is Gmail’s SMTP server. Next, it transfers the email to the Gmail mail server. The communication protocol between the mail servers is SMTP. 3. The Gmail server stores the email and makes it available to Bob, the recipient. 1114. Gmail client fetches new emails through the IMAP/POP server when Bob logs in to', metadata={'source': 'ignore/documents/SystemsDesign_bytebytego_raw.txt'}),\n",
      " Document(page_content=\"the DNS (not shown in the diagram) to find the address of the recipient’s SMTP server. In this case, it is Gmail’s SMTP server.

Please keep in mind this is a highly simplified design. Hope it sparks your interest and curiosity:) I'll explain each component in more depth in the future. 112Map rendering Google Maps Continued. Let’s take a look at 𝐌𝐚𝐩 𝐑𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 in this post. 𝐏𝐫𝐞-𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬 One foundational concept in map rendering is tiling. Instead of rendering the entire map as one large custom image, the world is broken up into smaller tiles. The client only downloads the relevant tiles for the area the user is in and stitches them together like a mosaic for display. The tiles are pre-computed at different zoom levels. Google Maps uses 21 zoom levels. For example, at zoom level 0, The entire map is represented by a single tile of size 256 * 256 pixels. Then at zoom level 1, the number of map tiles doubles in both north-south and east-west directions, while each tile stays at 256 * 256 pixels. So we have 4 tiles at zoom level 1, and the whole image of zoom level 1 is 512 * 512 pixels. With each increment, the entire set of tiles has 4x as many pixels as the previous level. The increased pixel count provides an increasing level of detail to the user. This allows the client to render the map at the best granularities depending on the client’s zoom level without consuming excessive bandwidth to download tiles with too much detail. This is especially important when we are loading the images from mobile clients. 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 Now that we have transformed massive maps into tiles, we also need to define a data structure for the roads. We divide the world of roads into small blocks. We call these blocks road segments. Each road segment contains multiple roads, junctions, and other metadata. We group nearby segments into super segments. This process can be applied repeatedly to meet the level of coverage required. We then transform the road segments into a data structure that the navigation algorithms can use. The typical approach is to convert the map into a 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉, where the nodes are road segments, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding road segments are reachable 113neighbors. In this way, finding a path between two locations becomes a shortest-path problem, where we can leverage Dijkstra or A* algorithms. 114Interview Question: Design Google Maps Google started project G𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 M𝐚𝐩𝐬 in 2005. As of March 2021, Google Maps had one billion daily active users, 99% coverage of the world in 200 countries. Although Google Maps is a very complex system, we can break it down into 3 high-level components. In this post, let’s take a look at how to design a simplified Google Maps. 115𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 The location service is responsible for recording a user’s location update. The Google Map clients send location updates every few seconds. The user location data is used in many cases: - detect new and recently closed roads - improve the accuracy of the map over time - used as an input for live traffic data. 𝐌𝐚𝐩 𝐑𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 The world’s map is projected into a huge 2D map image. It is broken down into small image blocks called “tiles” (see below). The tiles are static. They don’t change very often. An efficient way to serve static tile files is with a CDN backed by cloud storage like S3. The users can load the necessary tiles to compose a map from nearby CDN. What if a user is zooming and panning the map viewpoint on the client to explore their surroundings? An efficient way is to pre-calculate the map blocks with different zoom levels and load the images when needed. 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 This component is responsible for finding a reasonably fast route from point A to point B. It calls two services to help with the path calculation: 1⃣ Geocoding Service: resolve the given address to a latitude/longitude pair 2⃣ Route Planner Service: this service does three things in sequence: - Calculate the top-K shortest paths between A and B - Calculate the estimation of time for each path based on current traffic and historical data - Rank the paths by time predictions and user filtering. For example, the user doesn’t want to avoid tolls. 116Pull vs push models There are two ways metrics data can be collected, pull or push. It is a routine debate as to which one is better and there is no clear answer. In this post, we will take a look at the pull model. 117Figure 1 shows data collection with a pull model over HTTP. We have dedicated metric collectors which pull metrics values from the running applications periodically. In this approach, the metrics collector needs to know the complete list of service endpoints to pull data from. One naive approach is to use a file to hold DNS/IP information for every service endpoint on the “metric collector” servers. While the idea is simple, this approach is hard to maintain in a large-scale environment where servers are added or removed frequently, and we want to ensure that metric collectors don’t miss out on collecting metrics from any new servers. The good news is that we have a reliable, scalable, and maintainable solution available through Service Discovery, provided by Kubernetes, Zookeeper, etc., wherein services register their availability and the metrics collector can be notified by the Service Discovery component whenever the list of service endpoints changes. Service discovery contains configuration rules about when and where to collect metrics as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 explains the pull model in detail. 1⃣ The metrics collector fetches configuration metadata of service endpoints from Service Discovery. Metadata include pulling interval, IP addresses, timeout and retries parameters, etc. 2⃣ The metrics collector pulls metrics data via a pre-defined HTTP endpoint (for example, /metrics). To expose the endpoint, a client library usually needs to be added to the service. In Figure 3, the service is Web Servers. 3⃣ Optionally, the metrics collector registers a change event notification with Service Discovery to receive an update whenever the service endpoints change. Alternatively, the metrics collector can poll for endpoint changes periodically. 118Money movement One picture is worth more than a thousand words. This is what happens when you buy a product using Paypal/bank card under the hood. To understand this, we need to digest two concepts: 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Clearing is a process that calculates who should pay whom with how much money; while settlement is a process where real money moves between reserves in the settlement bank. 119Let’s say Bob wants to buy an SDI book from Claire’s shop on Amazon. - Pay-in flow (Bob pays Amazon money): 1.1 Bob buys a book on Amazon using Paypal. 1.2 Amazon issues a money transfer request to Paypal. 1.3 Since the payment token of Bob’s debit card is stored in Paypal, Paypal can transfer money, on Bob’s behalf, to Amazon’s bank account in Bank A. 1.4 Both Bank A and Bank B send transaction statements to the clearing institution. It reduces the transactions that need to be settled. Let’s assume Bank A owns Bank B $100 and Bank B owns bank A $500 at the end of the day. When they settle, the net position is that Bank B pays Bank A $400. 1.5 & 1.6 The clearing institution sends clearing and settlement information to the settlement bank. Both Bank A and Bank B have pre-deposited funds in the settlement bank as money reserves, so actual money movement happens between two reserve accounts in the settlement bank. - Pay-out flow (Amazon pays the money to the seller: Claire): 2.1 Amazon informs the seller (Claire) that she will get paid soon. 2.2 Amazon issues a money transfer request from its own bank (Bank A) to the seller bank (bank C). Here both banks record the transactions, but no real money is moved. 2.3 Both Bank A and Bank C send transaction statements to the clearing institution. 2.4 & 2.5 The clearing institution sends clearing and settlement information to the settlement bank. Money is transferred from Bank A’s reserve to Bank C’s reserve. Notice that we have three layers: - Transaction layer: where the online purchases happen - Payment and clearing layer: where the payment instructions and transaction netting happen - Settlement layer: where the actual money movement happen 120The first two layers are called information flow, and the settlement layer is called fund flow. You can see the 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝. In the info flow, the money seems to be deducted from one bank account and added to another bank account, but the actual money movement happens in the settlement bank at the end of the day. Because of the asynchronous nature of the info flow and the fund flow, reconciliation is very important for data consistency in the systems along with the flow. It makes things even more interesting when Bob wants to buy a book in the Indian market, where Bob pays USD but the seller can only receive INR. 121Reconciliation My previous post about painful payment reconciliation problems sparked lots of interesting discussions. One of the readers shared more problems we may face when working with intermediary payment processors in the trenches and a potential solution: 1. Foreign Currency Problem: When you operate a store globally, you will come across this problem quite frequently. To go back to the example from Paypal - if the transaction happens in a currency different from the standard currency of Paypal, this will create another layer, where the transaction is first received in that currency and exchanged to whatever currency your Paypal is using. There needs to be a reliable way to reconcile that currency exchange transaction. It certainly does not help that every payment provider handles this differently. 2. Payment providers are only that - intermediaries. Each purchase does not trigger two events for a company, but actually at least 4. The purchase via Paypal (where both the time and the currency dimension can come into play) trigger the debit/credit pair for the transaction and then, usually a few days later, another pair when the money is transferred from Paypal to a bank account (where there might be yet another FX discrepancy to reconcile if, for example, the initial purchase was in JPY, Paypal is set up in USD and your bank account is in EUR). There needs to be a way to reconcile all of these. 3. Some problems also pop up on the buyer side that is very platform-specific. One example is shadow transaction from Paypal: if you buy two items on Paypal with 1 week of time between the two transactions, Paypal will first debit money from your bank account for transaction A. If at the time of transaction B, transaction A has not gone through completely or is canceled, there might be a world where Paypal will use the money from transaction A to partially pay for transaction B, which leads to only a partial amount of transaction B being withdrawn from the bank account. In practice, this usually looks something like this: 1) Your shop assigns an order number to the purchase 1222) The order number is carried over to the payment provider 3) The payment provider creates another internal ID, which is carried over across transactions within the system 4) The payment ID is used when you get the payout on your bank account (or the payment provider bundles individual payments, which can be reconciled within the payment provider system) 5) Ideally, your payment provider and your shop have an integration/API with the tool you use to (hopefully automatically) create invoices. This usually carries over the order id from the shop (closing the loop) and sometimes even the payment id to match it with the invoice id, which you then can use to reconcile it with your accounts receivable/payable. :) Credit: A knowledgeable reader who prefers to stay private. Thank you! 123Continued: how to choose the right database for metrics collecting service? There are many storage systems available that are optimized for time-series data. The optimization lets us use far fewer servers to handle the same volume of data. Many of these databases also have custom query interfaces specially designed for the analysis of time-series data that are much easier to use than SQL. Some even provide features to manage data retention and data aggregation. Here are a few examples of time-series databases. OpenTSDB is a distributed time-series database, but since it is based on Hadoop and HBase, running a Hadoop/HBase cluster adds complexity. Twitter uses MetricsDB, and Amazon offers Timestream as a time-series database. According to DB-engines, the two most popular time-series databases are InfluxDB and Prometheus, which are designed to store large volumes of time-series data and quickly perform real-time analysis on that data. Both of them primarily rely on an in-memory cache and on-disk storage. And they both handle durability and performance quite well. According to the benchmark, an InfluxDB with 8 cores and 32GB RAM can handle over 250,000 writes per second. 124Since a time-series database is a specialized database, you are not expected to understand the internals in an interview unless you explicitly mentioned it in your resume. For the purpose of an interview, it’s important to understand the metrics data are time-series in nature and we can select time-series databases such as InfluxDB for storage to store them. Another feature of a strong time-series database is efficient aggregation and analysis of a large amount of time-series data by labels, also known as tags in some databases. For example, InfluxDB builds indexes on labels to facilitate the fast lookup of time-series by labels. It provides clear best-practice guidelines on how to use labels, without overloading the database. The key is to make sure each label is of low cardinality (having a small set of possible values). This feature is critical for visualization, and it would take a lot of effort to build this with a general-purpose database. 125Which database shall I use for the metrics collecting system? This is one of the most important questions we need to address in an interview. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 As shown in the diagram, each label on the y-axis represents a time series (uniquely identified by the names and labels) while the x-axis represents time. The write load is heavy. As you can see, there can be many time-series data points written at any moment. There are millions of operational metrics written per day, and many metrics are collected at high frequency, so the traffic is undoubtedly write-heavy. At the same time, the read load is spiky. Both visualization and alert services send queries to the database and depending on the access patterns of the graphs and alerts, the read volume could be bursty. 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 The data storage system is the heart of the design. It’s not recommended to build your own storage system or use a general-purpose storage system (MySQL) for this job. A general-purpose database, in theory, could support time-series data, but it would require expert-level tuning to make it work at our scale. Specifically, a relational database is not optimized for operations you would commonly perform against time-series data. For example, computing the moving average in a rolling time window requires complicated SQL that is difficult to read (there is an example of this in the deep dive section). Besides, to support tagging/labeling data, we need to add an index for each tag. Moreover, a general-purpose relational database does not perform well under constant heavy write load. At our scale, we would need to expend significant effort in tuning the database, and even then, it might not perform well. 126How about NoSQL? In theory, a few NoSQL databases on the market could handle time-series data effectively. For example, Cassandra and Bigtable can both be used for time series data. However, this would require deep knowledge of the internal workings of each NoSQL to devise a scalable schema for effectively storing and querying time-series data. With industrial-scale time-series databases readily available, using a general purpose NoSQL database is not appealing. There are many storage systems available that are optimized for time-series data. The optimization lets us use far fewer servers to handle the same volume of data. Many of these databases also have custom query interfaces specially designed for the analysis of time-series data that are much easier to use than SQL. Some even provide features to manage data retention and data aggregation. Here are a few examples of time-series databases. OpenTSDB is a distributed time-series database, but since it is based on Hadoop and HBase, running a Hadoop/HBase cluster adds complexity.

According to the benchmark listed on InfluxDB website, a DB server with 8 cores and 32GB RAM can handle over 250,000 writes per second. Since a time-series database is a specialized database, you are not expected to understand the internals in an interview unless you explicitly mentioned it in your resume. For the purpose of an interview, it’s important to understand the metrics data are time-series in nature and we can select time-series databases such as InfluxDB for storage to store them. Another feature of a strong time-series database is efficient aggregation and analysis of a large amount of time-series data by labels, also known as tags in some databases. For example, InfluxDB builds indexes on labels to facilitate the fast lookup of time-series by 127labels. It provides clear best-practice guidelines on how to use labels, without overloading the database. The key is to make sure each label is of low cardinality (having a small set of possible values). This feature is critical for visualization, and it would take a lot of effort to build this with a general-purpose database. 128Metrics monitoring and altering system A well-designed 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 and alerting system plays a key role in providing clear visibility into the health of the infrastructure to ensure high availability and reliability. The diagram below explains how it works at a high level. Metrics source: This can be application servers, SQL databases, message queues, etc. Metrics collector: It gathers metrics data and writes data into the time-series database. Time-series database: This stores metrics data as time series. It usually provides a custom query interface for analyzing and summarizing a large amount of time-series data. It maintains indexes on labels to facilitate the fast lookup of time-series data by labels. Kafka: Kafka is used as a highly reliable and scalable distributed messaging platform. It decouples the data collection and data processing services from each other. 129Consumers: Consumers or streaming processing services such as Apache Storm, Flink and Spark, process and push data to the time-series database. Query service: The query service makes it easy to query and retrieve data from the time-series database. This should be a very thin wrapper if we choose a good time-series database. It could also be entirely replaced by the time-series database’s own query interface. Alerting system: This sends alert notifications to various alerting destinations. Visualization system: This shows metrics in the form of various graphs/charts. 130Reconciliation 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 might be the most painful process in a payment system. It is the process of comparing records in different systems to make sure the amounts match each other. For example, if you pay $200 to buy a watch with Paypal: - The eCommerce website should have a record about the purchase order of $200. - There should be a transaction record of $200 in Paypal (marked with 2 in the diagram). - The Ledger should record a debit of $200 dollars for the buyer, and a credit of $200 for the seller. This is called double-entry bookkeeping (see the table below). Let’s take a look at some pain points and how we can address them: 131𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 1: Data normalization. When comparing records in different systems, they come in different formats. For example, the timestamp can be “2022/01/01” in one system and “Jan 1, 2022” in another. 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we can add a layer to transform different formats into the same format. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 2: Massive data volume 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we can use big data processing techniques to speed up data comparisons. If we need near real-time reconciliation, a streaming platform such as Flink is used; otherwise, end-of-day batch processing such as Hadoop is enough. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 3: Cut-off time issue. For example, if we choose 00:00:00 as the daily cut-off time, one record is stamped with 23:59:55 in the internal system, but might be stamped 00:00:30 in the external system (Paypal), which is the next day. In this case, we couldn’t find this record in today’s Paypal records. It causes a discrepancy. 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we need to categorize this break as a “temporary break” and run it later against the next day’s Paypal records. If we find a match in the next day’s Paypal records, the break is cleared, and no more action is needed. You may argue that if we have exactly-once semantics in the system, there shouldn’t be any discrepancies. But the truth is, there are so many places that can go wrong. Having a reconciliation system is always necessary. It is like having a safety net to keep you sleeping well at night. 132Which database shall I use? This is one of the most important questions we usually need to address in an interview. Choosing the right database is hard. Google Cloud recently posted a great article that summarized different database options available in Google Cloud and explained which use cases are best suited for each database option. 133Big data papers Below is a timeline of important big data papers and how the techniques evolved over time. The green highlighted boxes are the famous 3 Google papers, which established the foundation of the big data framework. At the high-level: 𝘉𝘪𝘨 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘴 = 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘢 + 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 Let’s look at the 𝐎𝐋𝐓𝐏 evolution. BigTable provided a distributed storage system for structured data but dropped some characteristics of relational DB. Then Megastore brought back schema and simple transactions; Spanner brought back data consistency. Now let’s look at the 𝐎𝐋𝐀𝐏 evolution. MapReduce was not easy to program, so Hive solved this by introducing a SQL-like query 134language. But Hive still used MapReduce under the hood, so it’s not very responsive. In 2010, Dremel provided an interactive query engine. 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 was born to further solve the latency issue in OLAP. The famous 𝒍𝒂𝒎𝒃𝒅𝒂 architecture was based on Storm and MapReduce, where streaming processing and batch processing have different processing flows. Then people started to build streaming processing with apache Kafka. 𝑲𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒂 architecture was proposed in 2014, where streaming and batching processings were merged into one flow. Google published The Dataflow Model in 2015, which was an abstraction standard for streaming processing, and Flink implemented this model. To manage a big crowd of commodity server resources, we need resource management Kubernetes. 135Avoid double charge One of the most serious problems a payment system can have is to 𝐝𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐚 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫. When we design the payment system, it is important to guarantee that the payment system executes a payment order exactly-once. 136At the first glance, exactly-once delivery seems very hard to tackle, but if we divide the problem into two parts, it is much easier to solve. Mathematically, an operation is executed exactly-once if: 1. It is executed at least once. 2. At the same time, it is executed at most once. We now explain how to implement at least once using retry and at most once using idempotency check. 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐲 Occasionally, we need to retry a payment transaction due to network errors or timeout. Retry provides the at-least-once guarantee. For example, as shown in Figure 10, the client tries to make a $10 payment, but the payment keeps failing due to a poor network connection. Considering the network condition might get better, the client retries the request and this payment finally succeeds at the fourth attempt. 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 From an API standpoint, idempotency means clients can make the same call repeatedly and produce the same result. For communication between clients (web and mobile applications) and servers, an idempotency key is usually a unique value that is generated by clients and expires after a certain period of time. A UUID is commonly used as an idempotency key and it is recommended by many tech companies such as Stripe and PayPal. To perform an idempotent payment request, an idempotency key is added to the HTTP header: <idempotency-key: key_value>. 137Payment security A few weeks ago, I posted the high-level design for the payment system. Today, I’ll continue the discussion and focus on payment security. The table below summarizes techniques that are commonly used in payment security. If you have any questions or I missed anything, please leave a comment. 138System Design Interview Tip One pro tip for acing a system design interview is to read the engineering blog of the company you are interviewing with. You can get a good sense of what technology they use, why the technology was chosen over others, and learn what issues are important to engineers. For example, here are 4 blog posts Twitter Engineering recommends: 1. The Infrastructure Behind Twitter: Scale 2. Discovery and Consumption of Analytics Data at Twitter 3. The what and why of product experimentation at Twitter 4. Twitter experimentation: technical overview 139Big data evolvement I hope everyone has a great time with friends and family during the holidays. If you are looking for some readings, classic engineering papers are a good start. A lot of times when we are busy with work, we only focus on scattered information, telling us “how” and “what” to get our immediate needs to get things done. However, reading the classics helps us know “why” behind the scenes, and teaches us how to solve problems, make better decisions, or even contribute to open source projects. Let’s take big data as an example. Big data area has progressed a lot over the past 20 years. It started from 3 Google papers (see the links in the comment), which tackled real engineering challenges at Google scale: - GFS (2003) - big data storage - MapReduce (2004) - calculation model - BigTable (2006) - online services The diagram below shows the functionalities and limitations of the 3 techniques, and how they evolve over time into two streams: OLTP and OLAP. Each evolved product was trying to solve the limitations of the 140last generation. For example, “Hive - support SQL” means Hive was trying to solve the lack of SQL in MapReduce. If you want to learn more, you can refer to the papers for details. What other classics would you recommend? 141Quadtree In this post, let’s explore another data structure to find nearby restaurants on Yelp or Google Maps. A quadtree is a data structure that is commonly used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants (grids) until the contents of the grids meet certain criteria (see the first diagram). 142Quadtree is an 𝐢𝐧-𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 and it is not a database solution. It runs on each LBS (Location-Based Service, see last week’s post) server, and the data structure is built at server start-up time. The second diagram explains the quadtree building process in more detail. The root node represents the whole world map. The root node is 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 broken down into 4 quadrants until no nodes are left with more than 100 businesses. 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐲 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞? - Build the quadtree in memory. - After the quadtree is built, start searching from the root and traverse the tree, until we find the leaf node where the search origin is. - If that leaf node has 100 businesses, return the node. Otherwise, add businesses from its neighbors until enough businesses are returned. 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐋𝐁𝐒 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞 - It may take a few minutes to build a quadtree in memory with 200 million businesses at the server start-up time. - While the quadtree is being built, the server cannot serve traffic. - Therefore, we should roll out a new release of the server incrementally to 𝐚 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐭 of servers at a time. This avoids taking a large swathe of the server cluster offline and causes service brownout. 143How do we find nearby restaurants on Yelp? Here are some design details behind the scenes. There are two key services (see the diagram below): - 𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 144- Add/delete/update restaurant information - Customers view restaurant details - 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥-𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 (𝐋𝐁𝐒) - Given a radius and location, return a list of nearby restaurants How are the restaurant locations stored in the database so that LBS can return nearby restaurants efficiently? Store the latitude and longitude of restaurants in the database? The query will be very inefficient when you need to calculate the distance between you and every restaurant. One way to speed up the search is using the 𝐠𝐞𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐡 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦. First, divide the planet into four quadrants along with the prime meridian and equator： - Latitude range [-90, 0] is represented by 0 - Latitude range [0, 90] is represented by 1 - Longitude range [-180, 0] is represented by 0 - Longitude range [0, 180] is represented by 1 Second, divide each grid into four smaller grids. Each grid can be represented by alternating between longitude bit and latitude bit. So when you want to search for the nearby restaurants in the red-highlighted block, you can write SQL like: SELECT * FROM geohash_index WHERE geohash LIKE `01%` Geohash has some limitations. There can be a lot of restaurants in one block (downtown New York), but none in another block (ocean). So there are other more complicated algorithms to optimize the process. Let me know if you are interested in the details. 145One picture is worth more than a thousand words. Log4j from attack to prevention in one illustration. Credit GovCERT Link: https://www.govcert.ch/blog/zero-day-exploit-targeting-popular-java-libr ary-log4j/ 146How does a modern stock exchange achieve microsecond latency? The principal is: 𝐃𝐨 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡！ - Fewer tasks on the critical path - Less time on each task - Fewer network hops - Less disk usage For the stock exchange, the critical path is: - 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭: an order comes into the order manager - mandatory risk checks - the order gets matched and the execution is sent back - 𝐞𝐧𝐝: the execution comes out of the order manager Other non-critical tasks should be removed from the critical path. We put together a design as shown in the diagram: 147- deploy all the components in a single giant server (no containers) - use shared memory as an event bus to communicate among the components, no hard disk - key components like Order Manager and Matching Engine are single-threaded on the critical path, and each pinned to a CPU so that there is 𝐧𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐬𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡 and 𝐧𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐬 - the single-threaded application loop executes tasks one by one in sequence - other components listen on the event bus and react accordingly 148Match buy and sell orders Stocks go up and down. Do you know what data structure is used to efficiently match buy and sell orders? Stock exchanges use the data structure called 𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬. An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders, organized by price levels. It has a buy book and a sell book, where each side of the book contains a bunch of price levels, and each price level contains a list of orders (first in first out). The image is an example of price levels and the queued quantity in each price level. So what happens when you place a market order to buy 2700 shares in the diagram? - The buy order is matched with all the sell onrders at price 100.10, and the first order at price 100.11 (illustrated in light red). 149- Now because of the big buy order which “eats up” the first price level on the sell book, the best ask price goes up from 100.10 to 100.11. - So when the market is bullish, people tend to buy stocks, and the price goes up and up. An efficient data structure for an order book must satisfy: - Constant lookup time. Operations include: get volume at a price level or between price levels, query best bid/ask. - Fast add/cancel/execute/update operations, preferably O(1) time complexity. Operations include: place a new order, cancel an order, and match an order. 150Stock exchange design The stock market has been volatile recently. Coincidentally, we just finished a new chapter “Design a stock exchange”. I’ll use plain English to explain what happens when you place a stock buying order. The focus is on the exchange side. Step 1: client places an order via the broker’s web or mobile app. Step 2: broker sends the order to the exchange. 151Step 3: the exchange client gateway performs operations such as validation, rate limiting, authentication, normalization, etc, and sends the order to the order manager. Step 4: the order manager performs risk checks based on rules set by the risk manager. Step 5: once risk checks pass, the order manager checks if there is enough balance in the wallet. Step 6-7: the order is sent to the matching engine. The matching engine sends back the execution result if a match is found. Both order and execution results need to be sequenced first in the sequencer so that matching determinism is guaranteed. Step 8 - 10: execution result is passed all the way back to the client. Step 11-12: market data (including the candlestick chart and order book) are sent to the data service for consolidation. Brokers query the data service to get the market data. Step 13: the reporter composes all the necessary reporting fields (e.g. client_id, price, quantity, order_type, filled_quantity, remaining_quantity) and writes the data to the database for persistence A stock exchange requires 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. While most web applications are ok with hundreds of milliseconds latency, a stock exchange requires 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨-𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. I’ll leave the latency discussion for a separate post since the post is already long. 152Design a payment system Today is Cyber Monday. Here is how money moves when you click the Buy button on Amazon or any of your favorite shopping websites. I posted the same diagram last week for an overview and a few people asked me about the detailed steps, so here you go: 1. When a user clicks the “Buy” button, a payment event is generated and sent to the payment service. 2. The payment service stores the payment event in the database. 3. Sometimes a single payment event may contain several payment orders. For example, you may select products from multiple sellers in a single checkout process. The payment service will call the payment executor for each payment order. 4. The payment executor stores the payment order in the database. 5. The payment executor calls an external PSP to finish the credit card payment. 6. After the payment executor has successfully executed the payment, the payment service will update the wallet to record how much money a given seller has. 1537. The wallet server stores the updated balance information in the database. 8. After the wallet service has successfully updated the seller’s balance information, the payment service will call the ledger to update it. 9. The ledger service appends the new ledger information to the database. 10. Every night the PSP or banks send settlement files to their clients. The settlement file contains the balance of the bank account, together with all the transactions that took place on this bank account during the day. 154Design a flash sale system Black Friday is coming. Designing a system with extremely high concurrency, high availability and quick responsiveness needs to consider many aspects 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝. See the below picture for details: 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬: 1. Less is more - less element on the web page, fewer data queries to the database, fewer web requests, fewer system dependencies 2.

We definitely don’t want to inform users that they have successfully placed orders but later tell them no items are actually available 156Back-of-the-envelope estimation Recently, a few engineers asked me whether we really need back-of-the-envelope estimation in a system design interview. I think it would be helpful to clarify. Estimations are important because we need them to understand the scale of the system and justify the design. It helps answer questions like: - Do we really need a distributed solution? - Is a cache layer necessary? - Shall we choose data replication or sharding? Here is an example of how the estimations shape the design decision. One interview question is to design proximity service and how to scale geospatial index is a key part of it. Here are a few paragraphs we wrote to show why jumping to a sharding design without estimations is a bad idea: “One common mistake about scaling the geospatial index is to quickly jump to a sharding scheme without considering the actual data size of the table. In our case, the full dataset for the geospatial index table is not large (quadtree index only takes 1.71G memory and storage requirement for geohash index is similar). The whole geospatial index can easily fit in the working set of a modern database server. However, depending on the read volume, a single database server might not have enough CPU or network bandwidth to service all read requests. If that is the case, it will be necessary to spread the read load among multiple database servers. There are two general approaches to spread the load of a relational database server. We can add read replicas or shard the database. Many engineers like to talk about sharding during interviews. However, it might not be a good fit for the geohash table. Sharding is complicated. The sharding logic has to be added to the application layer. Sometimes, sharding is the only option. In this case though, since everything can fit in the working set of a database server, there is no strong technical reason to shard the data among multiple servers. 157A better approach, in this case, is to have a series of read replicas to help with the read load. This method is much simpler to develop and maintain. Thus, we recommend scaling the geospatial index table through replicas.” — Check out our bestselling system design books.

What are they used for? Database isolation allows a transaction to execute as if there are no other concurrently running transactions. The diagram below illustrates four isolation levels. 🔹Serializalble: This is the highest isolation level. Concurrent transactions are guaranteed to be executed in sequence. 🔹Repeatable Read: Data read during the transaction stays the same as the transaction starts. 🔹Read Committed: Data modification can only be read after the transaction is committed. 4🔹Read Uncommitted: The data modification can be read by other transactions before a transaction is committed. The isolation is guaranteed by MVCC (Multi-Version Consistency Control) and locks. The diagram below takes Repeatable Read as an example to demonstrate how MVCC works: There are two hidden columns for each row: transaction_id and roll_pointer. When transaction A starts, a new Read View with transaction_id=201 is created. Shortly afterward, transaction B starts, and a new Read View with transaction_id=202 is created. Now transaction A modifies the balance to 200, a new row of the log is created, and the roll_pointer points to the old row. Before transaction A commits, transaction B reads the balance data. Transaction B finds that transaction_id 201 is not committed, it reads the next committed record(transaction_id=200). Even when transaction A commits, transaction B still reads data based on the Read View created when transaction B starts. So transaction B always reads the data with balance=100.

The diagram below illustrates the differences between IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). For a non-cloud application, we own and manage all the hardware and software. We say the application is on-premises. With cloud computing, cloud service vendors provide three kinds of models for us to use: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. 𝐈𝐚𝐚𝐒 provides us access to cloud vendors\\' infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networking. We pay for the infrastructure service and install and manage supporting software on it for our application. 𝐏𝐚𝐚𝐒 goes further. It provides a platform with a variety of middleware, frameworks, and tools to build our application. We only focus on application development and data. 𝐒𝐚𝐚𝐒 enables the application to run in the cloud. We pay a monthly or annual fee to use the SaaS product. Over to you: which IaaS/PaaS/SaaS products have you used? How do you decide which architecture to use? Image Source: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/iaas-paas-saas 6Most popular programming languages Programming languages come and go. Some stand the test of time. Some already are shooting stars and some are rising rapidly on the horizon. I draw a diagram by putting the top 38 most commonly used programming languages in one place, sorted by year. Data source: StackOverflow survey. 1 JavaScript 2 HTML/CSS 3 Python 4 SQL 5 Java 6 Node 7 TypeScript 8 C 9 Bash/Shell 10 C 11 PHP 712 C 13 PowerShell 14 Go 15 Kotlin 16 Rust 17 Ruby 18 Dart 19 Assembly 20 Swift 21 R 22 VBA 23 Matlab 24 Groovy 25 Objective-C 26 Scala 27 Perl 28 Haskell 29 Delphi 30 Clojure 31 Elixir 32 LISP 33 Julia 34 F 35 Erlang 36 APL 37 Crystal 38 COBOL Over to you: what’s the first programming language you learned? And what are the other languages you learned over the years? 8What is the future of online payments? I don’t know the answer, but I do know one of the candidates is the blockchain. As a fan of technology, I always seek new solutions to old challenges. A book that explains a lot about an emerging payment system is ‘Mastering Bitcoin’ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. I want to share my discovery of this book with you because it explains very clearly bitcoin and its underlying blockchain. This book makes me rethink how to renovate payment systems. Here are the takeaways: 1. The bitcoin wallet balance is calculated on the fly, while the traditional wallet balance is stored in the database. You can check chapter 12 of System Design Interview Volume 2, on how to implement a traditional wallet (https://amzn.to/34G2vmC). 92. The golden source of truth for bitcoin is the blockchain, which is also the journal. It’s the same if we use Event Sourcing architecture to build a traditional wallet, although there are other options. 3. There is a small virtual machine for bitcoin - and also Ethereum. The virtual machine defines a set of bytecodes to do basic tasks such as validation. Over to you: if Elon Musk set up a base on planet Mars, what payment solution will you recommend? 10What is SSO (Single Sign-On)? A friend recently went through the irksome experience of being signed out from a number of websites they use daily. This event will be familiar to millions of web users, and it is a tedious process to fix. It can involve trying to remember multiple long-forgotten passwords, or typing in the names of pets from childhood to answer security questions. SSO removes this inconvenience and makes life online better. But how does it work? Basically, Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication scheme. It allows a user to log in to different systems using a single ID. The diagram below illustrates how SSO works. Step 1: A user visits Gmail, or any email service. Gmail finds the user is not logged in and so redirects them to the SSO authentication server, which also finds the user is not logged in. As a result, the user 11is redirected to the SSO login page, where they enter their login credentials. Steps 2-3: The SSO authentication server validates the credentials, creates the global session for the user, and creates a token. Steps 4-7: Gmail validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the Gmail system, and returns “valid.” Gmail returns the protected resource to the user. Step 8: From Gmail, the user navigates to another Google-owned website, for example, YouTube. Steps 9-10: YouTube finds the user is not logged in, and then requests authentication. The SSO authentication server finds the user is already logged in and returns the token. Step 11-14: YouTube validates the token in the SSO authentication server. The authentication server registers the YouTube system, and returns “valid.” YouTube returns the protected resource to the user. The process is complete and the user gets back access to their account. Over to you: Question 1: have you implemented SSO in your projects? What is the most difficult part? Question 2: what’s your favorite sign-in method and why? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 12How to store passwords safely in the database? Let’s take a look. 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐨 🔹 Storing passwords in plain text is not a good idea because anyone with internal access can see them. 🔹 Storing password hashes directly is not sufficient because it is pruned to precomputation attacks, such as rainbow tables. 🔹 To mitigate precomputation attacks, we salt the passwords. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭? According to OWASP guidelines, “a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process”. 13𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭? 1⃣ A salt is not meant to be secret and it can be stored in plain text in the database. It is used to ensure the hash result is unique to each password. 2⃣ The password can be stored in the database using the following format: 𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘩( 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 + 𝘴𝘢𝘭𝘵). 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝? To validate a password, it can go through the following process: 1⃣ A client enters the password. 2⃣ The system fetches the corresponding salt from the database. 143⃣ The system appends the salt to the password and hashes it. Let’s call the hashed value H1. 4⃣ The system compares H1 and H2, where H2 is the hash stored in the database. If they are the same, the password is valid. Over to you: what other mechanisms can we use to ensure password safety? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 15How does HTTPS work? Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP.) HTTPS transmits encrypted data using Transport Layer Security (TLS.) If the data is hijacked online, all the hijacker gets is binary code. How is the data encrypted and decrypted? Step 1 - The client (browser) and the server establish a TCP connection. Step 2 - The client sends a “client hello” to the server. The message contains a set of necessary encryption algorithms (cipher suites) and the latest TLS version it can support. The server responds with a “server hello” so the browser knows whether it can support the algorithms and TLS version. 16The server then sends the SSL certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key, host name, expiry dates, etc. The client validates the certificate. Step 3 - After validating the SSL certificate, the client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key. The server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key. Step 4 - Now that both the client and the server hold the same session key (symmetric encryption), the encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel. Why does HTTPS switch to symmetric encryption during data transmission? There are two main reasons: 1. Security: The asymmetric encryption goes only one way. This means that if the server tries to send the encrypted data back to the client, anyone can decrypt the data using the public key. 2. Server resources: The asymmetric encryption adds quite a lot of mathematical overhead. It is not suitable for data transmissions in long sessions. Over to you: how much performance overhead does HTTPS add, compared to HTTP? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 17How to learn design patterns? Besides reading a lot of well-written code, a good book guides us like a good teacher. 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬, second edition, is the one I would recommend. When I began my journey in software engineering, I found it hard to understand the classic textbook, 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬, by the Gang of Four. Luckily, I discovered Head First Design Patterns in the school library. This book solved a lot of puzzles for me. When I went back to the Design Patterns book, everything looked familiar and more understandable. Last year, I bought the second edition of Head First Design Patterns and read through it. Here are a few things I like about the book: 18🔹 This book solves the challenge of software’s abstract, “invisible” nature. Software is difficult to build because we cannot see its architecture; its details are embedded in the code and binary files. It is even harder to understand software design patterns because these are higher-level abstractions of the software. The book fixes this by using visualization. There are lots of diagrams, arrows, and comments on almost every page. If I do not understand the text, it’s no problem. The diagrams explain things very well. 🔹 We all have questions we are afraid to ask when we first learn a new skill. Maybe we think it’s an easy one. This book is good at tackling design patterns from the student’s point of view. It guides us by asking our questions and clearly answering them. There is a Guru in the book and there’s also a Student. Over to you: which book helped you understand a challenging topic? Why do you like it? 19A visual guide on how to choose the right Database Picking a database is a long-term commitment so the decision shouldn’t be made lightly. The important thing to keep in mind is to choose the right database for the right job. 20Data can be structured (SQL table schema), semi-structured (JSON, XML, etc.), and unstructured (Blob). Common database categories include: 🔹 Relational 🔹 Columnar 🔹 Key-value 🔹 In-memory 🔹 Wide column 🔹 Time Series 🔹 Immutable ledger 🔹Geospatial 🔹Graph 🔹Document 🔹Text search 🔹Blob Thanks, Satish Chandra Gupta Over to you - Which database have you used for which workload? 21Do you know how to generate globally unique IDs? In this post, we will explore common requirements for IDs that are used in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Requirements: 🔹Globally unique 🔹Roughly sorted by time 🔹Numerical values only 🔹64 bits 🔹Highly scalable, low latency 22The implementation details of the algorithms can be found online so we will not go into detail here.

This post is a summary of a tech talk given by Twitter in 2013. Let’s take a look. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐓𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐭: 1⃣ A tweet comes in through the Write API. 2⃣ The Write API routes the request to the Fanout service. 3⃣ The Fanout service does a lot of processing and stores them in the Redis cache. 244⃣ The Timeline service is used to find the Redis server that has the home timeline on it. 5⃣ A user pulls their home timeline through the Timeline service. 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 & 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 🔹 Ingester: annotates and tokenizes Tweets so the data can be indexed. 🔹 Earlybird: stores search index. 🔹 Blender: creates the search and discovery timelines. 𝐏𝐮𝐬𝐡 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞 🔹HTTP push 🔹Mobile push Disclaimer: This article is based on the tech talk given by Twitter in 2013 (https://bit.ly/3vNfjRp).

Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 25What is the difference between Process and Thread? To better understand this question, let’s first take a look at what is a Program. A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 is an executable file containing a set of instructions and passively stored on disk. One program can have multiple processes. For example, the Chrome browser creates a different process for every single tab. A 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 means a program is in execution. When a program is loaded into the memory and becomes active, the program becomes a process. The process requires some essential resources such as registers, program counter, and stack. 26A 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 is the smallest unit of execution within a process. The following process explains the relationship between program, process, and thread. 1. The program contains a set of instructions. 2. The program is loaded into memory. It becomes one or more running processes. 3. When a process starts, it is assigned memory and resources. A process can have one or more threads. For example, in the Microsoft Word app, a thread might be responsible for spelling checking and the other thread for inserting text into the doc. Main differences between process and thread: 🔹 Processes are usually independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process. 🔹 Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory. 🔹 A process is a heavyweight operation. It takes more time to create and terminate. 🔹 Context switching is more expensive between processes. 🔹 Inter-thread communication is faster for threads. Over to you: 1). Some programming languages support coroutine. What is the difference between coroutine and thread? 2). How to list running processes in Linux? — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 27Interview Question: design Google Docs 1⃣ Clients send document editing operations to the WebSocket Server. 2⃣ The real-time communication is handled by the WebSocket Server. 3⃣ Documents operations are persisted in the Message Queue. 284⃣ The File Operation Server consumes operations produced by clients and generates transformed operations using collaboration algorithms. 5⃣ Three types of data are stored: file metadata, file content, and operations. One of the biggest challenges is real-time conflict resolution. Common algorithms include: 🔹 Operational transformation (OT) 🔹 Differential Synchronization (DS) 🔹 Conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) Google Doc uses OT according to its Wikipedia page and CRDT is an active area of research for real-time concurrent editing.

The diagram below illustrates the common ones. 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 In this model, we deploy new changes to multiple services simultaneously. This approach is easy to implement. But since all the services are upgraded at the same time, it is hard to manage and test dependencies. It’s also hard to rollback safely. 30𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞-𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 With blue-green deployment, we have two identical environments: one is staging (blue) and the other is production (green). The staging environment is one version ahead of production. Once testing is done in the staging environment, user traffic is switched to the staging environment, and the staging becomes the production. This deployment strategy is simple to perform rollback, but having two identical production quality environments could be expensive. 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 A canary deployment upgrades services gradually, each time to a subset of users. It is cheaper than blue-green deployment and easy to perform rollback. However, since there is no staging environment, we have to test on production. This process is more complicated because we need to monitor the canary while gradually migrating more and more users away from the old version. 𝐀/𝐁 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭 In the A/B test, different versions of services run in production simultaneously. Each version runs an “experiment” for a subset of users. A/B test is a cheap method to test new features in production. We need to control the deployment process in case some features are pushed to users by accident. Over to you - Which deployment strategy have you used? Did you witness any deployment-related outages in production and why did they happen? 31Flowchart of how slack decides to send a notification It is a great example of why a simple feature may take much longer to develop than many people think. When we have a great design, users may not notice the complexity because it feels like the feature is just working as intended. What’s your takeaway from this diagram?

It contains architecture-based articles that describe how Amazon architects, releases, and operates technology. As of today, it published 26 articles. It took me two weekends to go through all the articles. I’ve had great fun and learned a lot. Here are some of my favorites: 🔹Making retries safe with idempotent APIs 🔹Timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitter 🔹Beyond five 9s: Lessons from our highest available data planes 🔹Caching challenges and strategies 🔹Ensuring rollback safety during deployments 🔹Going faster with continuous delivery 33🔹Challenges with distributed systems 🔹Amazon\\'s approach to high-availability deployment Over to you: what’s your favorite place to learn system design and design principles? Link to The Amazon Builders\\' Library: aws.amazon.com/builders-library 34How to design a secure web API access for your website? When we open web API access to users, we need to make sure each API call is authenticated. This means the user must be who they claim to be. In this post, we explore two common ways: 1. Token based authentication 2. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) authentication The diagram below illustrates how they work. 35𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 Step 1 - the user enters their password into the client, and the client sends the password to the Authentication Server. 36Step 2 - the Authentication Server authenticates the credentials and generates a token with an expiry time. Steps 3 and 4 - now the client can send requests to access server resources with the token in the HTTP header. This access is valid until the token expires. 𝐇𝐌𝐀𝐂 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 This mechanism generates a Message Authentication Code (signature) by using a hash function (SHA256 or MD5). Steps 1 and 2 - the server generates two keys, one is Public APP ID (public key) and the other one is API Key (private key). Step 3 - we now generate a HMAC signature on the client side (hmac A). This signature is generated with a set of attributes listed in the diagram. Step 4 - the client sends requests to access server resources with hmac A in the HTTP header. Step 5 - the server receives the request which contains the request data and the authentication header. It extracts the necessary attributes from the request and uses the API key that’s stored on the server side to generate a signature (hmac B.) Steps 6 and 7 - the server compares hmac A (generated on the client side) and hmac B (generated on the server side). If they are matched, the requested resource will be returned to the client. Question - How does HMAC authentication ensure data integrity? Why do we include “request timestamp” in HMAC signature generation? — Check out our bestselling system design books.

The diagram below illustrates the collaboration of microservices. Choreography is like having a choreographer set all the rules. Then the dancers on stage (the microservices) interact according to them. Service choreography describes this exchange of messages and the rules by which the microservices interact. Orchestration is different. The orchestrator acts as a center of authority. It is responsible for invoking and combining the services. It 38describes the interactions between all the participating services. It is just like a conductor leading the musicians in a musical symphony. The orchestration pattern also includes the transaction management among different services. The benefits of orchestration: 1. Reliability - orchestration has built-in transaction management and error handling, while choreography is point-to-point communications and the fault tolerance scenarios are much more complicated. 2. Scalability - when adding a new service into orchestration, only the orchestrator needs to modify the interaction rules, while in choreography all the interacting services need to be modified. Some limitations of orchestration: 1. Performance - all the services talk via a centralized orchestrator, so latency is higher than it is with choreography. Also, the throughput is bound to the capacity of the orchestrator. 2. Single point of failure - if the orchestrator goes down, no services can talk to each other. To mitigate this, the orchestrator must be highly available. Real-world use case: Netflix Conductor is a microservice orchestrator and you can read more details on the orchestrator design.

The diagram below illustrates the layered architecture of virtualization and containerization. “Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system” [1]. “Containerization is the packaging together of software code with all its necessary components like libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies so that they are isolated in their own \"container\" [2]. The major differences are: 🔹 In virtualization, the hypervisor creates an abstraction layer over hardware, so that multiple operating systems can run alongside each other. This technique is considered to be the first generation of cloud computing. 🔹Containerization is considered to be a lightweight version of virtualization, which virtualizes the operating system instead of hardware. Without the hypervisor, the containers enjoy faster resource provisioning. All the resources (including code, dependencies) that are 40needed to run the application or microservice are packaged together, so that the applications can run anywhere. Question: how much performance differences have you observed in production between virtualization, containerization, and bare-metal? Image Source: https://lnkd.in/gaPYcGTz Sources: [1] Understanding virtualization: https://lnkd.in/gtQY9gkx [2] What is containerization?: https://lnkd.in/gm4Qv_x2 41Which cloud provider should be used when building a big data solution? The diagram below illustrates the detailed comparison of AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. 42The common parts of the solutions: 1. Data ingestion of structured or unstructured data. 2. Raw data storage. 3. Data processing, including filtering, transformation, normalization, etc. 4. Data warehouse, including key-value storage, relational database, OLAP database, etc. 5. Presentation layer with dashboards and real-time notifications. It is interesting to see different cloud vendors have different names for the same type of products. For example, the first step and the last step both use the serverless product. The product is called “lambda” in AWS, and “function” in Azure and Google Cloud. Question - which products have you used in production? What kind of application did you use it for? Source: S.C. Gupta’s post 43How to avoid crawling duplicate URLs at Google scale? Option 1: Use a Set data structure to check if a URL already exists or not. Set is fast, but it is not space-efficient. Option 2: Store URLs in a database and check if a new URL is in the database. This can work but the load to the database will be very high. Option 3: 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫. This option is preferred. Bloom filter was proposed by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970. It is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 🔹 false: the element is definitely not in the set. 🔹 true: the element is probably in the set. False-positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not. The diagram below illustrates how the Bloom filter works. The basic data structure for the Bloom filter is Bit Vector. Each bit represents a hashed value. 44Step 1: To add an element to the bloom filter, we feed it to 3 different hash functions (A, B, and C) and set the bits at the resulting positions. Note that both “www.myweb1.com” and “www.myweb2.com” mark the same bit with 1 at index 5. False positives are possible because a bit might be set by another element. Step 2: When testing the existence of a URL string, the same hash functions A, B, and C are applied to the URL string. If all three bits are 451, then the URL may exist in the dataset; if any of the bits is 0, then the URL definitely does not exist in the dataset. Hash function choices are important. They must be uniformly distributed and fast. For example, RedisBloom and Apache Spark use murmur, and InfluxDB uses xxhash. Question - In our example, we used three hash functions. How many hash functions should we use in reality? What are the trade-offs? — Check out our bestselling system design books.

Bits are stored into cells, which are made of floating-gate transistors. SSDs are made entirely of electronic components, there are no moving or mechanical parts like in hard drives (HDD)” [2]. The diagram below illustrates the SSD architecture. 47Step 1: “Commands come from the user through the host interface” [2]. The interface can be Serial ATA (SATA) or PCI Express (PCIe). Step 2: “The processor in the SSD controller takes the commands and passes them to the flash controller” [2]. Step 3: “SSDs also have embedded RAM memory, generally for caching purposes and to store mapping information” [2]. Step 4: “The packages of NAND flash memory are organized in gangs, over multiple channels” [2]. The second diagram illustrates how the logical and physical pages are mapped, and why this architecture is fast. SSD controller operates multiple FLASH particles in parallel, greatly improving the underlying bandwidth. When we need to write more than one page, the SSD controller can write them in parallel [3], whereas the HDD has a single head and it can only read from one head at a time. Every time a HOST Page is written, the SSD controller finds a Physical Page to write the data and this mapping is recorded. With this mapping, the next time HOST reads a HOST Page, the SSD knows where to read the data from FLASH [3]. Question - What are the main differences between SSD and HDD?

About 10 years ago, I witnessed the most impactful UI bugs in my career. It was 9PM on a Friday. I was on the team responsible for one of the largest social games at the time. It had about 30 million DAU. I just so happened to glance at the operational dashboard before shutting down for the night. Every line on the dashboard was at zero. At that very moment, I got a phone call from my boss. He said the entire game was down. Firefighting mode. Full on. Everything had shut down. Every single instance on AWS was terminated. HA proxy instances, PHP web servers, MySQL databases, Memcache nodes, everything. It took 50 people 10 hours to bring everything back up. It was quite a feat. That in itself is a story for another day. We used a cloud management software vendor to manage our AWS deployment. This was before Infrastructure as Code was a thing. There was no Terraform. It was so early in cloud computing and we were so big that AWS required an advanced warning before we scaled up. What had gone wrong? The software vendor had introduced a bug that week in their confirmation dialog flow. When terminating a subset of nodes in the UI, it would correctly show in the confirmation dialog box the list of nodes to be terminated, but under the hood, it terminated everything. Shortly before 9PM that fateful evening, one of our poor SREs fulfilled our routine request and terminated an unused Memcache pool. I could only imagine the horror and the phone conversation that ensured. 49What kind of code structure could allow this disastrous bug to slip through? We could only guess. We never received a full explanation. What are some of the most impactful software bugs you encountered in your career? 50AWS Lambda behind the scenes Serverless is one of the hottest topics in cloud services. How does AWS Lambda work behind the scenes? Lambda is a 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs functions in response to events. 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐕𝐌 Firecracker is the engine powering all of the Lambda functions [1]. It is a virtualization technology developed at Amazon and written in Rust. The diagram below illustrates the isolation model for AWS Lambda Workers. 51Lambda functions run within a sandbox, which provides a minimal Linux userland, some common libraries and utilities. It creates the Execution environment (worker) on EC2 instances. How are lambdas initiated and invoked? There are two ways. 𝐒𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 Step1: \"The Worker Manager communicates with a Placement Service which is responsible to place a workload on a location for the given host (it’s provisioning the sandbox) and returns that to the Worker Manager\" [2]. Step 2: \"The Worker Manager can then call 𝘐𝘯𝘪𝘵 to initialize the function for execution by downloading the Lambda package from S3 and setting up the Lambda runtime\" [2] Step 3: The Frontend Worker is now able to call 𝘐𝘯𝘷𝘰𝘬𝘦 [2]. 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 Step 1: The Application Load Balancer forwards the invocation to an available Frontend which places the event onto an internal queue(SQS). Step 2: There is \"a set of pollers assigned to this internal queue which are responsible for polling it and moving the event onto a Frontend synchronously. After it’s been placed onto the Frontend it follows the synchronous invocation call pattern which we covered earlier\" [2]. Question: Can you think of any use cases for AWS Lambda?

What problem does each generation of HTTP solve? The diagram below illustrates the key features. 🔹HTTP 1.0 was finalized and fully documented in 1996. Every request to the same server requires a separate TCP connection. 🔹HTTP 1.1 was published in 1997. A TCP connection can be left open for reuse (persistent connection), but it doesn’t solve the HOL (head-of-line) blocking issue. HOL blocking - when the number of allowed parallel requests in the browser is used up, subsequent requests need to wait for the former ones to complete. 53🔹HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015. It addresses HOL issue through request multiplexing, which eliminates HOL blocking at the application layer, but HOL still exists at the transport (TCP) layer. As you can see in the diagram, HTTP 2.0 introduced the concept of HTTP “streams”: an abstraction that allows multiplexing different HTTP exchanges onto the same TCP connection. Each stream doesn’t need to be sent in order. 🔹HTTP 3.0 first draft was published in 2020. It is the proposed successor to HTTP 2.0. It uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol, thus removing HOL blocking in the transport layer. QUIC is based on UDP. It introduces streams as first-class citizens at the transport layer. QUIC streams share the same QUIC connection, so no additional handshakes and slow starts are required to create new ones, but QUIC streams are delivered independently such that in most cases packet loss affecting one stream doesn\\'t affect others.

The diagram below illustrates the evolution of a simplified eCommerce website. It goes from a monolithic design on one single server, to a service-oriented/microservice architecture. 5556Suppose we have two services: inventory service (handles product descriptions and inventory management) and user service (handles user information, registration, login, etc.). Step 1 - With the growth of the user base, one single application server cannot handle the traffic anymore. We put the application server and the database server into two separate servers. Step 2 - The business continues to grow, and a single application server is no longer enough. So we deploy a cluster of application servers. Step 3 - Now the incoming requests have to be routed to multiple application servers, how can we ensure each application server gets an even load? The load balancer handles this nicely. Step 4 - With the business continuing to grow, the database might become the bottleneck. To mitigate this, we separate reads and writes in a way that frequent read queries go to read replicas. With this setup, the throughput for the database writes can be greatly increased. Step 5 - Suppose the business continues to grow. One single database cannot handle the load on both the inventory table and user table. We have a few options: 1. Vertical partition. Adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to the database server. It has a hard limit. 2. Horizontal partition by adding more database servers. 3. Adding a caching layer to offload read requests. Step 6 - Now we can modularize the functions into different services. The architecture becomes service-oriented / microservice.

Google published a series of articles about \"Inside look at modern web browser\". It\\'s a great read.

The advantages on data structures make Redis a good choice for: 🔹 Recording the number of clicks and comments for each post (hash) 🔹 Sorting the commented user list and deduping the users (zset) 🔹 Caching user behavior history and filtering malicious behaviors (zset, hash) 🔹 Storing boolean information of extremely large data into small space. For example, login status, membership status. (bitmap) 64Optimistic locking Optimistic locking, also referred to as optimistic concurrency control, allows multiple concurrent users to attempt to update the same resource. There are two common ways to implement optimistic locking: version number and timestamp. Version number is generally considered to be a better option because the server clock can be inaccurate over time. We explain how optimistic locking works with version number. The diagram below shows a successful case and a failure case. 1. A new column called “version” is added to the database table. 2. Before a user modifies a database row, the application reads the version number of the row. 3. When the user updates the row, the application increases the version number by 1 and writes it back to the database. 4. A database validation check is put in place; the next version number should exceed the current version number by 1. The transaction aborts if the validation fails and the user tries again from step 2. 65Optimistic locking is usually faster than pessimistic locking because we do not lock the database. However, the performance of optimistic locking drops dramatically when concurrency is high. To understand why, consider the case when many clients try to reserve a hotel room at the same time. Because there is no limit on how many clients can read the available room count, all of them read back the same available room count and the current version number. When different clients make reservations and write back the results to the database, only one of them will succeed, and the rest of the clients receive a version check failure message. These clients have to retry. In the subsequent round of retries, there is only one successful client again, and the rest have to retry. Although the end result is correct, repeated retries cause a very unpleasant user experience. Question: what are the possible ways of solving race conditions? 66Tradeoff between latency and consistency Understanding the 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐬 is very important not only in system design interviews but also designing real-world systems. When we talk about data replication, there is a fundamental tradeoff between 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 and 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. It is illustrated by the diagram below. 67Cache miss attack Caching is awesome but it doesn’t come without a cost, just like many things in life. One of the issues is 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐬 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤. Correct me if this is not the right term. It refers to the scenario where data to fetch doesn\\'t exist in the database and the data isn’t cached either. So every request hits the database eventually, defeating the purpose of using a cache. If a malicious user initiates lots of queries with such keys, the database can easily be overloaded. The diagram below illustrates the process. Two approaches are commonly used to solve this problem: 68🔹Cache keys with null value. Set a short TTL (Time to Live) for keys with null value. 🔹Using Bloom filter. A Bloom filter is a data structure that can rapidly tell us whether an element is present in a set or not. If the key exists, the request first goes to the cache and then queries the database if needed. If the key doesn\\'t exist in the data set, it means the key doesn’t exist in the cache/database. In this case, the query will not hit the cache or database layer. — Check out our bestselling system design books.

The diagram below illustrates helpful tools in a Linux system. 🔹‘vmstat’ - reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity. 🔹‘iostat’ - reports CPU and input/output statistics of the system. 🔹‘netstat’ - displays statistical data related to IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. 🔹‘lsof’ - lists open files of the current system. 🔹‘pidstat’ - monitors the utilization of system resources by all or specified processes, including CPU, memory, device IO, task switching, threads, etc. 70What are the top cache strategies? Read data from the system: 🔹 Cache aside 🔹 Read through Write data to the system: 🔹 Write around 🔹 Write back 🔹 Write through The diagram below illustrates how those 5 strategies work.

Before we answer this question, let\\'s take a look at why we need to optimize this process. Some files might be larger than a few GBs. It is possible to upload such a large object file directly, but it could take a long time. If the network connection fails in the middle of the upload, we have to start over. A better solution is to slice a large object into smaller parts and upload them independently. After all the parts are uploaded, the object store re-assembles the object from the parts. This process is called 𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝. The diagram below illustrates how multipart upload works: 741. The client calls the object storage to initiate a multipart upload. 2. The data store returns an uploadID, which uniquely identifies the upload. 3. The client splits the large file into small objects and starts uploading. Let’s assume the size of the file is 1.6GB and the client splits it into 8 parts, so each part is 200 MB in size. The client uploads the first part to the data store together with the uploadID it received in step 2. 4. When a part is uploaded, the data store returns an ETag, which is essentially the md5 checksum of that part. It is used to verify multipart uploads. 5. After all parts are uploaded, the client sends a complete multipart upload request, which includes the uploadID, part numbers, and ETags. 6. The data store reassembles the object from its parts based on the part number. Since the object is really large, this process may take a few minutes. After reassembly is complete, it returns a success message to the client. — Check out our bestselling system design books. Paperback: Amazon Digital: ByteByteGo. 75Why is Redis so Fast?

What role does it play in cross-border payments? You can find answers to those questions in this post. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is the main secure 𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 that links the world’s banks. The Belgium-based system is run by its member banks and handles millions of payment messages per day. The diagram below illustrates how payment messages are transmitted from Bank A (in New York) to Bank B (in London). Step 1: Bank A sends a message with transfer details to Regional Processor A in New York. The destination is Bank B. 77Step 2: Regional processor validates the format and sends it to Slice Processor A. The Regional Processor is responsible for input message validation and output message queuing. The Slice Processor is responsible for storing and routing messages safely. Step 3: Slice Processor A stores the message. Step 4: Slice Processor A informs Regional Processor A the message is stored. Step 5: Regional Processor A sends ACK/NAK to Bank A. ACK means a message will be sent to Bank B. NAK means the message will NOT be sent to Bank B. Step 6: Slice Processor A sends the message to Regional Processor B in London. Step 7: Regional Processor B stores the message temporarily. Step 8: Regional Processor B assigns a unique ID MON (Message Output Number) to the message and sends it to Slice Processor B Step 9: Slice Processor B validates MON. Step 10: Slice Processor B authorizes Regional Processor B to send the message to Bank B. Step 11: Regional Processor B sends the message to Bank B. Step 12: Bank B receives the message and stores it. Step 13: Bank B sends UAK/UNK to Regional Processor B. UAK (user positive acknowledgment) means Bank B received the message without error; UNK (user negative acknowledgment) means Bank B received checksum failure. Step 14: Regional Processor B creates a report based on Bank B’s response, and sends it to Slice Processor B. 78Step 15: Slice Processor B stores the report. Step 16 - 17: Slice Processor B sends a copy of the report to Slice Processor A. Slice Processor A stores the report. — Check out our bestselling system design books.

Message queues provide communication and coordination for those building blocks. Today, let’s discuss different delivery semantics: at-most once, at-least once, and exactly once. 𝐀𝐭-𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 As the name suggests, at-most once means a message will be delivered not more than once. Messages may be lost but are not redelivered. This is how at-most once delivery works at the high level. Use cases: It is suitable for use cases like monitoring metrics, where a small amount of data loss is acceptable. 𝐀𝐭-𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 With this data delivery semantic, it’s acceptable to deliver a message more than once, but no message should be lost. Use cases: With at-least once, messages won’t be lost but the same message might be delivered multiple times. While not ideal from a user perspective, at-least once delivery semantics are usually good enough for use cases where data duplication is not a big issue or deduplication 80is possible on the consumer side. For example, with a unique key in each message, a message can be rejected when writing duplicate data to the database. 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 Exactly once is the most difficult delivery semantic to implement. It is friendly to users, but it has a high cost for the system’s performance and complexity. Use cases: Financial-related use cases (payment, trading, accounting, etc.). Exactly once is especially important when duplication is not acceptable and the downstream service or third party doesn’t support idempotency. Question: what is the difference between message queues vs event streaming platforms such as Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc? 81Vertical partitioning and Horizontal partitioning In many large-scale applications, data is divided into partitions that can be accessed separately. There are two typical strategies for partitioning data. 🔹 Vertical partitioning: it means some columns are moved to new tables. Each table contains the same number of rows but fewer columns (see diagram below). 🔹 Horizontal partitioning (often called sharding): it divides a table into multiple smaller tables. Each table is a separate data store, and it contains the same number of columns, but fewer rows (see diagram below). 82Horizontal partitioning is widely used so let’s take a closer look. 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦 Routing algorithm decides which partition (shard) stores the data. 🔹 Range-based sharding. This algorithm uses ordered columns, such as integers, longs, timestamps, to separate the rows. For example, the diagram below uses the User ID column for range partition: User IDs 1 and 2 are in shard 1, User IDs 3 and 4 are in shard 2. 🔹 Hash-based sharding. This algorithm applies a hash function to one column or several columns to decide which row goes to which table. For example, the diagram below uses 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐃 𝐦𝐨𝐝 2 as a hash function. User IDs 1 and 3 are in shard 1, User IDs 2 and 4 are in shard 2. 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 🔹 Facilitate horizontal scaling. Sharding facilitates the possibility of adding more machines to spread out the load. 🔹 Shorten response time. By sharding one table into multiple tables, queries go over fewer rows, and results are returned much more quickly. 𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐰𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬 🔹 The order by the operation is more complicated. Usually, we need to fetch data from different shards and sort the data in the application\\'s code. 🔹 Uneven distribution. Some shards may contain more data than others (this is also called the hotspot). This topic is very big and I’m sure I missed a lot of important details. What else do you think is important for data partitioning? 83CDN A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed servers (also called edge servers) which provide fast delivery of static and dynamic content. Let’s take a look at how it works. Suppose Bob who lives in New York wants to visit an eCommerce website that is deployed in London. If the request goes to servers located in London, the response will be quite slow. So we deploy CDN servers close to where Bob lives, and the content will be loaded from the nearby CDN server. The diagram below illustrates the process: 1. Bob types in www.myshop.com in the browser. The browser looks up the domain name in the local DNS cache. 842. If the domain name does not exist in the local DNS cache, the browser goes to the DNS resolver to resolve the name. The DNS resolver usually sits in the Internet Service Provider (ISP). 3. The DNS resolver recursively resolves the domain name (see my previous post for details). Finally, it asks the authoritative name server to resolve the domain name. 4. If we don’t use CDN, the authoritative name server returns the IP address for www.myshop.com. But with CDN, the authoritative name server has an alias pointing to www.myshop.cdn.com (the domain name of the CDN server). 5. The DNS resolver asks the authoritative name server to resolve www.myshop.cdn.com. 6. The authoritative name server returns the domain name for the load balancer of CDN www.myshop.lb.com. 7. The DNS resolver asks the CDN load balancer to resolve www.myshop.lb.com. The load balancer chooses an optimal CDN edge server based on the user’s IP address, user’s ISP, the content requested, and the server load. 8. The CDN load balancer returns the CDN edge server’s IP address for www.myshop.lb.com. 9. Now we finally get the actual IP address to visit. The DNS resolver returns the IP address to the browser. 10. The browser visits the CDN edge server to load the content. There are two types of contents cached on the CDN servers: static contents and dynamic contents. The former contains static pages, pictures, and videos; the latter one includes results of edge computing. 11. If the edge CDN server cache doesn\\'t contain the content, it goes upward to the regional CDN server. If the content is still not found, it will go upward to the central CDN server, or even go to the origin - the 85London web server. This is called the CDN distribution network, where the servers are deployed geographically. Over to you: How do you prevent videos cached on CDN from being pirated? 86Erasure coding A really cool technique that’s commonly used in object storage such as S3 to improve durability is called 𝐄𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠. Let’s take a look at how it works. 87Erasure coding deals with data durability differently from replication. It chunks data into smaller pieces (placed on different servers) and creates parities for redundancy. In the event of failures, we can use chunk data and parities to reconstruct the data. Let’s take a look at a concrete example (4 + 2 erasure coding) as shown in Figure 1. 1⃣ Data is broken up into four even-sized data chunks d1, d2, d3, and d4. 2⃣ The mathematical formula is used to calculate the parities p1 and p2. To give a much simplified example, p1 = d1 + 2*d2 - d3 + 4*d4 and p2 = -d1 + 5*d2 + d3 - 3*d4. 3⃣ Data d3 and d4 are lost due to node crashes. 4⃣ The mathematical formula is used to reconstruct lost data d3 and d4, using the known values of d1, d2, p1, and p2. How much extra space does erasure coding need? For every two chunks of data, we need one parity block, so the storage overhead is 50% (Figure 2). While in 3-copy replication, the storage overhead is 200% (Figure 2). Does erasure coding increase data durability? Let’s assume a node has a 0.81% annual failure rate. According to the calculation done by Backblaze, erasure coding can achieve 11 nines durability vs 3-copy replication can achieve 6 nines durability. What other techniques do you think are important to improve the scalability and durability of an object store such as S3? 88Foreign exchange in payment Have you wondered what happens under the hood when you pay with USD online and the seller from Europe receives EUR (euro)? This process is called foreign exchange. Suppose Bob (the buyer) needs to pay 100 USD to Alice (the seller), and Alice can only receive EUR. The diagram below illustrates the process. 1. Bob sends 100 USD via a third-party payment provider. In our example, it is Paypal. The money is transferred from Bob’s bank account (Bank B) to Paypal’s account in Bank P1. 2. Paypal needs to convert USD to EUR. It leverages the foreign exchange provider (Bank E). Paypal sends 100 USD to its USD account in Bank E. 893. 100 USD is sold to Bank E’s funding pool. 4. Bank E’s funding pool provides 88 EUR in exchange for 100 USD. The money is put into Paypal’s EUR account in Bank E. 5. Paypal’s EUR account in Bank P2 receives 88 EUR. 6. 88 EUR is paid to Alice’s EUR account in Bank A. Now let’s take a close look at the foreign exchange (forex) market. It has 3 layers: 🔹 Retail market. Funding pools are parts of the retail market. To improve efficiency, Paypal usually buys a certain amount of foreign currencies in advance. 🔹 Wholesale market. The wholesale business is composed of investment banks, commercial banks, and foreign exchange providers. It usually handles accumulated orders from the retail market. 🔹 Top-level participants. They are multinational commercial banks that hold a large number of certificates of deposit from different countries. They exchange these certificates for foreign exchange trading. When Bank E’s funding pool needs more EUR, it goes upward to the wholesale market to sell USD and buy EUR. When the wholesale market accumulates enough orders, it goes upward to top-level participants. Steps 3.1-3.3 and 4.1-4.3 explain how it works. If you have any questions, please leave a comment. What foreign currency did you find difficult to exchange? And what company have you used for foreign currency exchange? 90Interview Question: Design S3 What happens when you upload a file to Amazon S3? Let’s design an S3 like object storage system. Before we dive into the design, let’s define some terms. 91𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭. A logical container for objects. The bucket name is globally unique. To upload data to S3, we must first create a bucket. 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭. An object is an individual piece of data we store in a bucket. It contains object data (also called payload) and metadata. Object data can be any sequence of bytes we want to store. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. An S3 object consists of (Figure 1): 🔹 Metadata. It is mutable and contains attributes such as ID, bucket name, object name, etc. 🔹 Object data. It is immutable and contains the actual data. In S3, an object resides in a bucket. The path looks like this: /bucket-to-share/script.txt. The bucket only has metadata. The object has metadata and the actual data. The diagram below (Figure 2) illustrates how file uploading works. In this example, we first create a bucket named “bucket-to-share” and then upload a file named “script.txt” to the bucket. 1. The client sends an HTTP PUT request to create a bucket named “bucket-to-share.” The request is forwarded to the API service. 2. The API service calls the Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure the user is authorized and has WRITE permission. 3. The API service calls the metadata store to create an entry with the bucket info in the metadata database. Once the entry is created, a success message is returned to the client. 4. After the bucket is created, the client sends an HTTP PUT request to create an object named “script.txt”. 5. The API service verifies the user’s identity and ensures the user has WRITE permission on the bucket. 926. Once validation succeeds, the API service sends the object data in the HTTP PUT payload to the data store. The data store persists the payload as an object and returns the UUID of the object. 7. The API service calls the metadata store to create a new entry in the metadata database. It contains important metadata such as the object_id (UUID), bucket_id (which bucket the object belongs to), object_name, etc. 93Block storage, file storage and object storage Yesterday, I posted the definitions of block storage, file storage, and object storage. Let’s continue the discussion and compare those 3 options. 94Block storage, file storage and object storage In this post, let’s review the storage systems in general. Storage systems fall into three broad categories: 🔹 Block storage 🔹 File storage 🔹 Object storage The diagram below illustrates the comparison of different storage systems. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 Block storage came first, in the 1960s. Common storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD) that are physically attached to servers are all considered as block storage. Block storage presents the raw blocks to the server as a volume. This is the most flexible and versatile form of storage. The server can format the raw blocks and use them as a file system, or it can hand control of those blocks to an application. Some applications like a database or a virtual machine engine manage these blocks directly in order to squeeze every drop of performance out of them. Block storage is not limited to physically attached storage. Block storage could be connected to a server over a high-speed network or over industry-standard connectivity protocols like Fibre Channel (FC) 95and iSCSI. Conceptually, the network-attached block storage still presents raw blocks. To the servers, it works the same as physically attached block storage. Whether to a network or physically attached, block storage is fully owned by a single server. It is not a shared resource. 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 File storage is built on top of block storage. It provides a higher-level abstraction to make it easier to handle files and directories. Data is stored as files under a hierarchical directory structure. File storage is the most common general-purpose storage solution. File storage could be made accessible by a large number of servers using common file-level network protocols like SMB/CIFS and NFS. The servers accessing file storage do not need to deal with the complexity of managing the blocks, formatting volume, etc. The simplicity of file storage makes it a great solution for sharing a large number of files and folders within an organization. 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 Object storage is new. It makes a very deliberate tradeoff to sacrifice performance for high durability, vast scale, and low cost. It targets relatively “cold” data and is mainly used for archival and backup. Object storage stores all data as objects in a flat structure. There is no hierarchical directory structure. Data access is normally provided via a RESTful API. It is relatively slow compared to other storage types. Most public cloud service providers have an object storage offering, such as AWS S3, Google block storage, and Azure blob storage. 96Domain Name System (DNS) lookup DNS acts as an address book. It translates human-readable domain names (google.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (142.251.46.238). To achieve better scalability, the DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical tree structure. There are 3 basic levels of DNS servers: 1. Root name server (.). It stores the IP addresses of Top Level Domain (TLD) name servers. There are 13 logical root name servers globally. 2. TLD name server. It stores the IP addresses of authoritative name servers. There are several types of TLD names. For example, generic TLD (.com, .org), country code TLD (.us), test TLD (.test). 3. Authoritative name server. It provides actual answers to the DNS query. You can register authoritative name servers with domain name registrar such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc. The diagram below illustrates how DNS lookup works under the hood: 1. google.com is typed into the browser, and the browser sends the domain name to the DNS resolver. 972. The resolver queries a DNS root name server. 3. The root server responds to the resolver with the address of a TLD DNS server. In this case, it is .com. 4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD. 5. The TLD server responds with the IP address of the domain’s name server, google.com (authoritative name server). 6. The DNS resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver. 7. The IP address for google.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver. 8. The DNS resolver responds to the web browser with the IP address (142.251.46.238) of the domain requested initially. DNS lookups on average take between 20-120 milliseconds to complete (according to YSlow). 98What happens when you type a URL into your browser? The diagram below illustrates the steps. 1. Bob enters a URL into the browser and hits Enter. In this example, the URL is composed of 4 parts: 🔹 scheme - 𝒉𝒕𝒕𝒑𝒔://. This tells the browser to send a connection to the server using HTTPS. 🔹 domain - 𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆.𝒄𝒐𝒎. This is the domain name of the site. 🔹 path - 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒕/𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒄. It is the path on the server to the requested resource: phone. 🔹 resource - 𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒏𝒆. It is the name of the resource Bob wants to visit. 2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain with a domain name system (DNS) lookup. To make the lookup process fast, data is cached at different layers: browser cache, OS cache, local network cache and ISP cache. 992.1 If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found (this will be covered in another post). 3. Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server. 4. The browser sends a HTTP request to the server. The request looks like this: 𝘎𝘌𝘛 /𝘱𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 𝘏𝘰𝘴𝘵: 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦.𝘤𝘰𝘮 5. The server processes the request and sends back the response. For a successful response (the status code is 200). The HTML response might look like this: 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 200 𝘖𝘒 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘦: 𝘚𝘶𝘯, 30 𝘑𝘢𝘯 2022 00:01:01 𝘎𝘔𝘛 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳: 𝘈𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵-𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦: 𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵/𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭; 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘵=𝘶𝘵𝘧-8 <!𝘋𝘖𝘊𝘛𝘠𝘗𝘌 𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭> <𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨=\"𝘦𝘯\"> 𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥 </𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭> 6. The browser renders the HTML content. 100AI Coding engine DeepMind says its new AI coding engine (AlphaCode) is as good as an average programmer. The AI bot participated in the 10 Codeforces coding competitions and was ranked 54.3%. It means its score exceeded half of the human contestants. If we look at its score for the last 6 months, AlphaCode ranks at 28%. The diagram below explains how the AI bot works: 1. Pre-train the transformer models on GitHub code. 2. Fine-tune the models on the relatively small competitive programming dataset. 3. At evaluation time, create a massive amount of solutions for each problem. 4. Filter, cluster and rerank the solutions to a small set of candidate programs (at most 10), and then submit for further assessments. 5. Run the candidate programs against the test cases, evaluate the performance, and choose the best one. 101Do you think AI bot will be better at Leetcode or competitive programming than software engineers five years from now? 102Read replica pattern There are two common ways to implement the read replica pattern: 1. Embed the routing logic in the application code (explained in the last post). 2. Use database middleware. We focus on option 2 here. The middleware provides transparent routing between the application and database servers. We can customize the routing logic based on difficult rules such as user, schema, statement, etc. The diagram below illustrates the setup: 1031. When Alice places an order on amazon, the request is sent to Order Service. 2. Order Service does not directly interact with the database. Instead, it sends database queries to the database middleware. 3. The database middleware routes writes to the primary database. Data is replicated to two replicas. 4. Alice views the order details (read). The request is sent through the middleware. 5. Alice views the recent order history (read). The request is sent through the middleware. The database middleware acts as a proxy between the application and databases. It uses standard MySQL network protocol for communication. Pros: - Simplified application code. The application doesn’t need to be aware of the database topology and manage access to the database directly. - Better compatibility. The middleware uses the MySQL network protocol. Any MySQL compatible client can connect to the middleware easily. This makes database migration easier. Cons: - Increased system complexity. A database middleware is a complex system. Since all database queries go through the middleware, it usually requires a high availability setup to avoid a single point of failure. - Additional middleware layer means additional network latency. Therefore, this layer requires excellent performance. 104Read replica pattern In this post, we talk about a simple yet commonly used database design pattern (setup): 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧. In this setup, all data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update are sent to the primary DB, and reads are sent to read replicas. The diagram below illustrates the setup: 1. When Alice places an order on amazon.com, the request is sent to Order Service. 2. Order Service creates a record about the order in the primary DB (write). Data is replicated to two replicas. 3. Alice views the order details. Data is served from a replica (read). 4. Alice views the recent order history. Data is served from a replica (read). There is one major problem in this setup: 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐚𝐠. 105Under certain circumstances (network delay, server overload, etc.), data in replicas might be seconds or even minutes behind. In this case, if Alice immediately checks the order status (query is served by the replica) after the order is placed, she might not see the order at all. This leaves Alice confused. In this case, we need “read-after-write” consistency. Possible solutions to mitigate this problem: 1⃣ Latency sensitive reads are sent to the primary database. 2⃣ Reads that immediately follow writes are routed to the primary database. 3⃣ A relational DB generally provides a way to check if a replica is caught up with the primary. If data is up to date, query the replica. Otherwise, fail the read request or read from the primary. 106Email receiving flow The following diagram demonstrates the email receiving flow. 1. Incoming emails arrive at the SMTP load balancer. 2. The load balancer distributes traffic among SMTP servers. Email acceptance policy can be configured and applied at the SMTP-connection level. For example, invalid emails are bounced to avoid unnecessary email processing. 3. If the attachment of an email is too large to put into the queue, we can put it into the attachment store (s3). 4. Emails are put in the incoming email queue. The queue decouples mail processing workers from SMTP servers so they can be scaled independently. Moreover, the queue serves as a buffer in case the email volume surges. 5. Mail processing workers are responsible for a lot of tasks, including filtering out spam mails, stopping viruses, etc. The following steps assume an email passed the validation. 6. The email is stored in the mail storage, cache, and object data store. 1077. If the receiver is currently online, the email is pushed to real-time servers. 8. Real-time servers are WebSocket servers that allow clients to receive new emails in real-time. 9. For offline users, emails are stored in the storage layer. When a user comes back online, the webmail client connects to web servers via RESTful API. 10. Web servers pull new emails from the storage layer and return them to the client. 108Email sending flow In this post, we will take a closer look at the email sending flow. 1. A user writes an email on webmail and presses the “send” button. The request is sent to the load balancer. 2. The load balancer makes sure it doesn’t exceed the rate limit and routes traffic to web servers. 3. Web servers are responsible for: - Basic email validation. Each incoming email is checked against pre-defined rules such as email size limit. - Checking if the domain of the recipient’s email address is the same as the sender. If it is the same, email data is inserted to storage, cache, and object store directly. The recipient can fetch the email directly via the RESTful API. There is no need to go to step 4. 4. Message queues. 1094.a. If basic email validation succeeds, the email data is passed to the outgoing queue. 4.b. If basic email validation fails, the email is put in the error queue. 5. SMTP outgoing workers pull events from the outgoing queue and make sure emails are spam and virus free. 6. The outgoing email is stored in the “Sent Folder” of the storage layer. 7. SMTP outgoing workers send the email to the recipient mail server. Each message in the outgoing queue contains all the metadata required to create an email. A distributed message queue is a critical component that allows asynchronous mail processing. By decoupling SMTP outgoing workers from the web servers, we can scale SMTP outgoing workers independently. We monitor the size of the outgoing queue very closely. If there are many emails stuck in the queue, we need to analyze the cause of the issue. Here are some possibilities: - The recipient’s mail server is unavailable. In this case, we need to retry sending the email at a later time. Exponential backoff might be a good retry strategy. - Not enough consumers to send emails. In this case, we may need more consumers to reduce the processing time. 110Interview Question: Design Gmail One picture is worth more than a thousand words. In this post, we will take a look at what happens when Alice sends an email to Bob. 1. Alice logs in to her Outlook client, composes an email, and presses “send”. The email is sent to the Outlook mail server. The communication protocol between the Outlook client and mail server is SMTP. 2. Outlook mail server queries the DNS (not shown in the diagram) to find the address of the recipient’s SMTP server. In this case, it is Gmail’s SMTP server. Next, it transfers the email to the Gmail mail server. The communication protocol between the mail servers is SMTP. 3. The Gmail server stores the email and makes it available to Bob, the recipient. 1114. Gmail client fetches new emails through the IMAP/POP server when Bob logs in to', metadata={'source': 'ignore/documents/SystemsDesign_bytebytego_raw.txt'}),\n",

Please keep in mind this is a highly simplified design. Hope it sparks your interest and curiosity:) I'll explain each component in more depth in the future. 112Map rendering Google Maps Continued. Let’s take a look at 𝐌𝐚𝐩 𝐑𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 in this post. 𝐏𝐫𝐞-𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬 One foundational concept in map rendering is tiling. Instead of rendering the entire map as one large custom image, the world is broken up into smaller tiles. The client only downloads the relevant tiles for the area the user is in and stitches them together like a mosaic for display. The tiles are pre-computed at different zoom levels. Google Maps uses 21 zoom levels. For example, at zoom level 0, The entire map is represented by a single tile of size 256 * 256 pixels. Then at zoom level 1, the number of map tiles doubles in both north-south and east-west directions, while each tile stays at 256 * 256 pixels. So we have 4 tiles at zoom level 1, and the whole image of zoom level 1 is 512 * 512 pixels. With each increment, the entire set of tiles has 4x as many pixels as the previous level. The increased pixel count provides an increasing level of detail to the user. This allows the client to render the map at the best granularities depending on the client’s zoom level without consuming excessive bandwidth to download tiles with too much detail. This is especially important when we are loading the images from mobile clients. 𝐑𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 Now that we have transformed massive maps into tiles, we also need to define a data structure for the roads. We divide the world of roads into small blocks. We call these blocks road segments. Each road segment contains multiple roads, junctions, and other metadata. We group nearby segments into super segments. This process can be applied repeatedly to meet the level of coverage required. We then transform the road segments into a data structure that the navigation algorithms can use. The typical approach is to convert the map into a 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉, where the nodes are road segments, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding road segments are reachable 113neighbors. In this way, finding a path between two locations becomes a shortest-path problem, where we can leverage Dijkstra or A* algorithms. 114Interview Question: Design Google Maps Google started project G𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 M𝐚𝐩𝐬 in 2005. As of March 2021, Google Maps had one billion daily active users, 99% coverage of the world in 200 countries. Although Google Maps is a very complex system, we can break it down into 3 high-level components. In this post, let’s take a look at how to design a simplified Google Maps. 115𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 The location service is responsible for recording a user’s location update. The Google Map clients send location updates every few seconds. The user location data is used in many cases: - detect new and recently closed roads - improve the accuracy of the map over time - used as an input for live traffic data. 𝐌𝐚𝐩 𝐑𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 The world’s map is projected into a huge 2D map image. It is broken down into small image blocks called “tiles” (see below). The tiles are static. They don’t change very often. An efficient way to serve static tile files is with a CDN backed by cloud storage like S3. The users can load the necessary tiles to compose a map from nearby CDN. What if a user is zooming and panning the map viewpoint on the client to explore their surroundings? An efficient way is to pre-calculate the map blocks with different zoom levels and load the images when needed. 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 This component is responsible for finding a reasonably fast route from point A to point B. It calls two services to help with the path calculation: 1⃣ Geocoding Service: resolve the given address to a latitude/longitude pair 2⃣ Route Planner Service: this service does three things in sequence: - Calculate the top-K shortest paths between A and B - Calculate the estimation of time for each path based on current traffic and historical data - Rank the paths by time predictions and user filtering. For example, the user doesn’t want to avoid tolls. 116Pull vs push models There are two ways metrics data can be collected, pull or push. It is a routine debate as to which one is better and there is no clear answer. In this post, we will take a look at the pull model. 117Figure 1 shows data collection with a pull model over HTTP. We have dedicated metric collectors which pull metrics values from the running applications periodically. In this approach, the metrics collector needs to know the complete list of service endpoints to pull data from. One naive approach is to use a file to hold DNS/IP information for every service endpoint on the “metric collector” servers. While the idea is simple, this approach is hard to maintain in a large-scale environment where servers are added or removed frequently, and we want to ensure that metric collectors don’t miss out on collecting metrics from any new servers. The good news is that we have a reliable, scalable, and maintainable solution available through Service Discovery, provided by Kubernetes, Zookeeper, etc., wherein services register their availability and the metrics collector can be notified by the Service Discovery component whenever the list of service endpoints changes. Service discovery contains configuration rules about when and where to collect metrics as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 explains the pull model in detail. 1⃣ The metrics collector fetches configuration metadata of service endpoints from Service Discovery. Metadata include pulling interval, IP addresses, timeout and retries parameters, etc. 2⃣ The metrics collector pulls metrics data via a pre-defined HTTP endpoint (for example, /metrics). To expose the endpoint, a client library usually needs to be added to the service. In Figure 3, the service is Web Servers. 3⃣ Optionally, the metrics collector registers a change event notification with Service Discovery to receive an update whenever the service endpoints change. Alternatively, the metrics collector can poll for endpoint changes periodically. 118Money movement One picture is worth more than a thousand words. This is what happens when you buy a product using Paypal/bank card under the hood. To understand this, we need to digest two concepts: 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Clearing is a process that calculates who should pay whom with how much money; while settlement is a process where real money moves between reserves in the settlement bank. 119Let’s say Bob wants to buy an SDI book from Claire’s shop on Amazon. - Pay-in flow (Bob pays Amazon money): 1.1 Bob buys a book on Amazon using Paypal. 1.2 Amazon issues a money transfer request to Paypal. 1.3 Since the payment token of Bob’s debit card is stored in Paypal, Paypal can transfer money, on Bob’s behalf, to Amazon’s bank account in Bank A. 1.4 Both Bank A and Bank B send transaction statements to the clearing institution. It reduces the transactions that need to be settled. Let’s assume Bank A owns Bank B $100 and Bank B owns bank A $500 at the end of the day. When they settle, the net position is that Bank B pays Bank A $400. 1.5 & 1.6 The clearing institution sends clearing and settlement information to the settlement bank. Both Bank A and Bank B have pre-deposited funds in the settlement bank as money reserves, so actual money movement happens between two reserve accounts in the settlement bank. - Pay-out flow (Amazon pays the money to the seller: Claire): 2.1 Amazon informs the seller (Claire) that she will get paid soon. 2.2 Amazon issues a money transfer request from its own bank (Bank A) to the seller bank (bank C). Here both banks record the transactions, but no real money is moved. 2.3 Both Bank A and Bank C send transaction statements to the clearing institution. 2.4 & 2.5 The clearing institution sends clearing and settlement information to the settlement bank. Money is transferred from Bank A’s reserve to Bank C’s reserve. Notice that we have three layers: - Transaction layer: where the online purchases happen - Payment and clearing layer: where the payment instructions and transaction netting happen - Settlement layer: where the actual money movement happen 120The first two layers are called information flow, and the settlement layer is called fund flow. You can see the 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝. In the info flow, the money seems to be deducted from one bank account and added to another bank account, but the actual money movement happens in the settlement bank at the end of the day. Because of the asynchronous nature of the info flow and the fund flow, reconciliation is very important for data consistency in the systems along with the flow. It makes things even more interesting when Bob wants to buy a book in the Indian market, where Bob pays USD but the seller can only receive INR. 121Reconciliation My previous post about painful payment reconciliation problems sparked lots of interesting discussions. One of the readers shared more problems we may face when working with intermediary payment processors in the trenches and a potential solution: 1. Foreign Currency Problem: When you operate a store globally, you will come across this problem quite frequently. To go back to the example from Paypal - if the transaction happens in a currency different from the standard currency of Paypal, this will create another layer, where the transaction is first received in that currency and exchanged to whatever currency your Paypal is using. There needs to be a reliable way to reconcile that currency exchange transaction. It certainly does not help that every payment provider handles this differently. 2. Payment providers are only that - intermediaries. Each purchase does not trigger two events for a company, but actually at least 4. The purchase via Paypal (where both the time and the currency dimension can come into play) trigger the debit/credit pair for the transaction and then, usually a few days later, another pair when the money is transferred from Paypal to a bank account (where there might be yet another FX discrepancy to reconcile if, for example, the initial purchase was in JPY, Paypal is set up in USD and your bank account is in EUR). There needs to be a way to reconcile all of these. 3. Some problems also pop up on the buyer side that is very platform-specific. One example is shadow transaction from Paypal: if you buy two items on Paypal with 1 week of time between the two transactions, Paypal will first debit money from your bank account for transaction A. If at the time of transaction B, transaction A has not gone through completely or is canceled, there might be a world where Paypal will use the money from transaction A to partially pay for transaction B, which leads to only a partial amount of transaction B being withdrawn from the bank account. In practice, this usually looks something like this: 1) Your shop assigns an order number to the purchase 1222) The order number is carried over to the payment provider 3) The payment provider creates another internal ID, which is carried over across transactions within the system 4) The payment ID is used when you get the payout on your bank account (or the payment provider bundles individual payments, which can be reconciled within the payment provider system) 5) Ideally, your payment provider and your shop have an integration/API with the tool you use to (hopefully automatically) create invoices. This usually carries over the order id from the shop (closing the loop) and sometimes even the payment id to match it with the invoice id, which you then can use to reconcile it with your accounts receivable/payable. :) Credit: A knowledgeable reader who prefers to stay private. Thank you! 123Continued: how to choose the right database for metrics collecting service? There are many storage systems available that are optimized for time-series data. The optimization lets us use far fewer servers to handle the same volume of data. Many of these databases also have custom query interfaces specially designed for the analysis of time-series data that are much easier to use than SQL. Some even provide features to manage data retention and data aggregation. Here are a few examples of time-series databases. OpenTSDB is a distributed time-series database, but since it is based on Hadoop and HBase, running a Hadoop/HBase cluster adds complexity. Twitter uses MetricsDB, and Amazon offers Timestream as a time-series database. According to DB-engines, the two most popular time-series databases are InfluxDB and Prometheus, which are designed to store large volumes of time-series data and quickly perform real-time analysis on that data. Both of them primarily rely on an in-memory cache and on-disk storage. And they both handle durability and performance quite well. According to the benchmark, an InfluxDB with 8 cores and 32GB RAM can handle over 250,000 writes per second. 124Since a time-series database is a specialized database, you are not expected to understand the internals in an interview unless you explicitly mentioned it in your resume. For the purpose of an interview, it’s important to understand the metrics data are time-series in nature and we can select time-series databases such as InfluxDB for storage to store them. Another feature of a strong time-series database is efficient aggregation and analysis of a large amount of time-series data by labels, also known as tags in some databases. For example, InfluxDB builds indexes on labels to facilitate the fast lookup of time-series by labels. It provides clear best-practice guidelines on how to use labels, without overloading the database. The key is to make sure each label is of low cardinality (having a small set of possible values). This feature is critical for visualization, and it would take a lot of effort to build this with a general-purpose database. 125Which database shall I use for the metrics collecting system? This is one of the most important questions we need to address in an interview. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 As shown in the diagram, each label on the y-axis represents a time series (uniquely identified by the names and labels) while the x-axis represents time. The write load is heavy. As you can see, there can be many time-series data points written at any moment. There are millions of operational metrics written per day, and many metrics are collected at high frequency, so the traffic is undoubtedly write-heavy. At the same time, the read load is spiky. Both visualization and alert services send queries to the database and depending on the access patterns of the graphs and alerts, the read volume could be bursty. 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 The data storage system is the heart of the design. It’s not recommended to build your own storage system or use a general-purpose storage system (MySQL) for this job. A general-purpose database, in theory, could support time-series data, but it would require expert-level tuning to make it work at our scale. Specifically, a relational database is not optimized for operations you would commonly perform against time-series data. For example, computing the moving average in a rolling time window requires complicated SQL that is difficult to read (there is an example of this in the deep dive section). Besides, to support tagging/labeling data, we need to add an index for each tag. Moreover, a general-purpose relational database does not perform well under constant heavy write load. At our scale, we would need to expend significant effort in tuning the database, and even then, it might not perform well. 126How about NoSQL? In theory, a few NoSQL databases on the market could handle time-series data effectively. For example, Cassandra and Bigtable can both be used for time series data. However, this would require deep knowledge of the internal workings of each NoSQL to devise a scalable schema for effectively storing and querying time-series data. With industrial-scale time-series databases readily available, using a general purpose NoSQL database is not appealing. There are many storage systems available that are optimized for time-series data. The optimization lets us use far fewer servers to handle the same volume of data. Many of these databases also have custom query interfaces specially designed for the analysis of time-series data that are much easier to use than SQL. Some even provide features to manage data retention and data aggregation. Here are a few examples of time-series databases.

It provides clear best-practice guidelines on how to use labels, without overloading the database. The key is to make sure each label is of low cardinality (having a small set of possible values). This feature is critical for visualization, and it would take a lot of effort to build this with a general-purpose database. 128Metrics monitoring and altering system A well-designed 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 and alerting system plays a key role in providing clear visibility into the health of the infrastructure to ensure high availability and reliability. The diagram below explains how it works at a high level. Metrics source: This can be application servers, SQL databases, message queues, etc. Metrics collector: It gathers metrics data and writes data into the time-series database. Time-series database: This stores metrics data as time series. It usually provides a custom query interface for analyzing and summarizing a large amount of time-series data. It maintains indexes on labels to facilitate the fast lookup of time-series data by labels. Kafka: Kafka is used as a highly reliable and scalable distributed messaging platform. It decouples the data collection and data processing services from each other. 129Consumers: Consumers or streaming processing services such as Apache Storm, Flink and Spark, process and push data to the time-series database. Query service: The query service makes it easy to query and retrieve data from the time-series database. This should be a very thin wrapper if we choose a good time-series database. It could also be entirely replaced by the time-series database’s own query interface. Alerting system: This sends alert notifications to various alerting destinations. Visualization system: This shows metrics in the form of various graphs/charts. 130Reconciliation 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 might be the most painful process in a payment system. It is the process of comparing records in different systems to make sure the amounts match each other. For example, if you pay $200 to buy a watch with Paypal: - The eCommerce website should have a record about the purchase order of $200. - There should be a transaction record of $200 in Paypal (marked with 2 in the diagram). - The Ledger should record a debit of $200 dollars for the buyer, and a credit of $200 for the seller. This is called double-entry bookkeeping (see the table below). Let’s take a look at some pain points and how we can address them: 131𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 1: Data normalization. When comparing records in different systems, they come in different formats. For example, the timestamp can be “2022/01/01” in one system and “Jan 1, 2022” in another. 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we can add a layer to transform different formats into the same format. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 2: Massive data volume 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we can use big data processing techniques to speed up data comparisons. If we need near real-time reconciliation, a streaming platform such as Flink is used; otherwise, end-of-day batch processing such as Hadoop is enough. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 3: Cut-off time issue. For example, if we choose 00:00:00 as the daily cut-off time, one record is stamped with 23:59:55 in the internal system, but might be stamped 00:00:30 in the external system (Paypal), which is the next day. In this case, we couldn’t find this record in today’s Paypal records. It causes a discrepancy. 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: we need to categorize this break as a “temporary break” and run it later against the next day’s Paypal records. If we find a match in the next day’s Paypal records, the break is cleared, and no more action is needed. You may argue that if we have exactly-once semantics in the system, there shouldn’t be any discrepancies. But the truth is, there are so many places that can go wrong. Having a reconciliation system is always necessary. It is like having a safety net to keep you sleeping well at night. 132Which database shall I use? This is one of the most important questions we usually need to address in an interview. Choosing the right database is hard. Google Cloud recently posted a great article that summarized different database options available in Google Cloud and explained which use cases are best suited for each database option. 133Big data papers Below is a timeline of important big data papers and how the techniques evolved over time. The green highlighted boxes are the famous 3 Google papers, which established the foundation of the big data framework. At the high-level: 𝘉𝘪𝘨 𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘴 = 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘢 + 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 Let’s look at the 𝐎𝐋𝐓𝐏 evolution. BigTable provided a distributed storage system for structured data but dropped some characteristics of relational DB. Then Megastore brought back schema and simple transactions; Spanner brought back data consistency. Now let’s look at the 𝐎𝐋𝐀𝐏 evolution. MapReduce was not easy to program, so Hive solved this by introducing a SQL-like query 134language. But Hive still used MapReduce under the hood, so it’s not very responsive. In 2010, Dremel provided an interactive query engine. 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 was born to further solve the latency issue in OLAP. The famous 𝒍𝒂𝒎𝒃𝒅𝒂 architecture was based on Storm and MapReduce, where streaming processing and batch processing have different processing flows. Then people started to build streaming processing with apache Kafka. 𝑲𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒂 architecture was proposed in 2014, where streaming and batching processings were merged into one flow. Google published The Dataflow Model in 2015, which was an abstraction standard for streaming processing, and Flink implemented this model. To manage a big crowd of commodity server resources, we need resource management Kubernetes. 135Avoid double charge One of the most serious problems a payment system can have is to 𝐝𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐚 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫. When we design the payment system, it is important to guarantee that the payment system executes a payment order exactly-once. 136At the first glance, exactly-once delivery seems very hard to tackle, but if we divide the problem into two parts, it is much easier to solve. Mathematically, an operation is executed exactly-once if: 1. It is executed at least once. 2. At the same time, it is executed at most once. We now explain how to implement at least once using retry and at most once using idempotency check. 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐲 Occasionally, we need to retry a payment transaction due to network errors or timeout. Retry provides the at-least-once guarantee. For example, as shown in Figure 10, the client tries to make a $10 payment, but the payment keeps failing due to a poor network connection. Considering the network condition might get better, the client retries the request and this payment finally succeeds at the fourth attempt. 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 From an API standpoint, idempotency means clients can make the same call repeatedly and produce the same result. For communication between clients (web and mobile applications) and servers, an idempotency key is usually a unique value that is generated by clients and expires after a certain period of time. A UUID is commonly used as an idempotency key and it is recommended by many tech companies such as Stripe and PayPal. To perform an idempotent payment request, an idempotency key is added to the HTTP header: <idempotency-key: key_value>. 137Payment security A few weeks ago, I posted the high-level design for the payment system. Today, I’ll continue the discussion and focus on payment security. The table below summarizes techniques that are commonly used in payment security. If you have any questions or I missed anything, please leave a comment. 138System Design Interview Tip One pro tip for acing a system design interview is to read the engineering blog of the company you are interviewing with. You can get a good sense of what technology they use, why the technology was chosen over others, and learn what issues are important to engineers. For example, here are 4 blog posts Twitter Engineering recommends: 1. The Infrastructure Behind Twitter: Scale 2. Discovery and Consumption of Analytics Data at Twitter 3. The what and why of product experimentation at Twitter 4. Twitter experimentation: technical overview 139Big data evolvement I hope everyone has a great time with friends and family during the holidays. If you are looking for some readings, classic engineering papers are a good start. A lot of times when we are busy with work, we only focus on scattered information, telling us “how” and “what” to get our immediate needs to get things done. However, reading the classics helps us know “why” behind the scenes, and teaches us how to solve problems, make better decisions, or even contribute to open source projects. Let’s take big data as an example. Big data area has progressed a lot over the past 20 years. It started from 3 Google papers (see the links in the comment), which tackled real engineering challenges at Google scale: - GFS (2003) - big data storage - MapReduce (2004) - calculation model - BigTable (2006) - online services The diagram below shows the functionalities and limitations of the 3 techniques, and how they evolve over time into two streams: OLTP and OLAP. Each evolved product was trying to solve the limitations of the 140last generation. For example, “Hive - support SQL” means Hive was trying to solve the lack of SQL in MapReduce. If you want to learn more, you can refer to the papers for details. What other classics would you recommend? 141Quadtree In this post, let’s explore another data structure to find nearby restaurants on Yelp or Google Maps. A quadtree is a data structure that is commonly used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants (grids) until the contents of the grids meet certain criteria (see the first diagram). 142Quadtree is an 𝐢𝐧-𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 and it is not a database solution. It runs on each LBS (Location-Based Service, see last week’s post) server, and the data structure is built at server start-up time. The second diagram explains the quadtree building process in more detail. The root node represents the whole world map. The root node is 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐲 broken down into 4 quadrants until no nodes are left with more than 100 businesses. 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐲 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞? - Build the quadtree in memory. - After the quadtree is built, start searching from the root and traverse the tree, until we find the leaf node where the search origin is. - If that leaf node has 100 businesses, return the node. Otherwise, add businesses from its neighbors until enough businesses are returned. 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐋𝐁𝐒 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐞 - It may take a few minutes to build a quadtree in memory with 200 million businesses at the server start-up time. - While the quadtree is being built, the server cannot serve traffic. - Therefore, we should roll out a new release of the server incrementally to 𝐚 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐭 of servers at a time. This avoids taking a large swathe of the server cluster offline and causes service brownout. 143How do we find nearby restaurants on Yelp? Here are some design details behind the scenes. There are two key services (see the diagram below): - 𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 144- Add/delete/update restaurant information - Customers view restaurant details - 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥-𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 (𝐋𝐁𝐒) - Given a radius and location, return a list of nearby restaurants How are the restaurant locations stored in the database so that LBS can return nearby restaurants efficiently? Store the latitude and longitude of restaurants in the database? The query will be very inefficient when you need to calculate the distance between you and every restaurant. One way to speed up the search is using the 𝐠𝐞𝐨𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐡 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦. First, divide the planet into four quadrants along with the prime meridian and equator： - Latitude range [-90, 0] is represented by 0 - Latitude range [0, 90] is represented by 1 - Longitude range [-180, 0] is represented by 0 - Longitude range [0, 180] is represented by 1 Second, divide each grid into four smaller grids. Each grid can be represented by alternating between longitude bit and latitude bit. So when you want to search for the nearby restaurants in the red-highlighted block, you can write SQL like: SELECT * FROM geohash_index WHERE geohash LIKE `01%` Geohash has some limitations. There can be a lot of restaurants in one block (downtown New York), but none in another block (ocean). So there are other more complicated algorithms to optimize the process. Let me know if you are interested in the details. 145One picture is worth more than a thousand words. Log4j from attack to prevention in one illustration. Credit GovCERT Link: https://www.govcert.ch/blog/zero-day-exploit-targeting-popular-java-libr ary-log4j/ 146How does a modern stock exchange achieve microsecond latency? The principal is: 𝐃𝐨 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡！ - Fewer tasks on the critical path - Less time on each task - Fewer network hops - Less disk usage For the stock exchange, the critical path is: - 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭: an order comes into the order manager - mandatory risk checks - the order gets matched and the execution is sent back - 𝐞𝐧𝐝: the execution comes out of the order manager Other non-critical tasks should be removed from the critical path. We put together a design as shown in the diagram: 147- deploy all the components in a single giant server (no containers) - use shared memory as an event bus to communicate among the components, no hard disk - key components like Order Manager and Matching Engine are single-threaded on the critical path, and each pinned to a CPU so that there is 𝐧𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐬𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡 and 𝐧𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐬 - the single-threaded application loop executes tasks one by one in sequence - other components listen on the event bus and react accordingly 148Match buy and sell orders Stocks go up and down. Do you know what data structure is used to efficiently match buy and sell orders? Stock exchanges use the data structure called 𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐬. An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders, organized by price levels. It has a buy book and a sell book, where each side of the book contains a bunch of price levels, and each price level contains a list of orders (first in first out). The image is an example of price levels and the queued quantity in each price level. So what happens when you place a market order to buy 2700 shares in the diagram? - The buy order is matched with all the sell onrders at price 100.10, and the first order at price 100.11 (illustrated in light red). 149- Now because of the big buy order which “eats up” the first price level on the sell book, the best ask price goes up from 100.10 to 100.11. - So when the market is bullish, people tend to buy stocks, and the price goes up and up. An efficient data structure for an order book must satisfy: - Constant lookup time. Operations include: get volume at a price level or between price levels, query best bid/ask. - Fast add/cancel/execute/update operations, preferably O(1) time complexity. Operations include: place a new order, cancel an order, and match an order. 150Stock exchange design The stock market has been volatile recently. Coincidentally, we just finished a new chapter “Design a stock exchange”. I’ll use plain English to explain what happens when you place a stock buying order. The focus is on the exchange side. Step 1: client places an order via the broker’s web or mobile app. Step 2: broker sends the order to the exchange. 151Step 3: the exchange client gateway performs operations such as validation, rate limiting, authentication, normalization, etc, and sends the order to the order manager. Step 4: the order manager performs risk checks based on rules set by the risk manager. Step 5: once risk checks pass, the order manager checks if there is enough balance in the wallet. Step 6-7: the order is sent to the matching engine. The matching engine sends back the execution result if a match is found. Both order and execution results need to be sequenced first in the sequencer so that matching determinism is guaranteed. Step 8 - 10: execution result is passed all the way back to the client. Step 11-12: market data (including the candlestick chart and order book) are sent to the data service for consolidation. Brokers query the data service to get the market data. Step 13: the reporter composes all the necessary reporting fields (e.g. client_id, price, quantity, order_type, filled_quantity, remaining_quantity) and writes the data to the database for persistence A stock exchange requires 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐥𝐨𝐰 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. While most web applications are ok with hundreds of milliseconds latency, a stock exchange requires 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨-𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. I’ll leave the latency discussion for a separate post since the post is already long. 152Design a payment system Today is Cyber Monday. Here is how money moves when you click the Buy button on Amazon or any of your favorite shopping websites. I posted the same diagram last week for an overview and a few people asked me about the detailed steps, so here you go: 1. When a user clicks the “Buy” button, a payment event is generated and sent to the payment service. 2. The payment service stores the payment event in the database. 3. Sometimes a single payment event may contain several payment orders. For example, you may select products from multiple sellers in a single checkout process. The payment service will call the payment executor for each payment order. 4. The payment executor stores the payment order in the database. 5. The payment executor calls an external PSP to finish the credit card payment. 6. After the payment executor has successfully executed the payment, the payment service will update the wallet to record how much money a given seller has. 1537. The wallet server stores the updated balance information in the database. 8. After the wallet service has successfully updated the seller’s balance information, the payment service will call the ledger to update it. 9. The ledger service appends the new ledger information to the database. 10. Every night the PSP or banks send settlement files to their clients. The settlement file contains the balance of the bank account, together with all the transactions that took place on this bank account during the day. 154Design a flash sale system Black Friday is coming. Designing a system with extremely high concurrency, high availability and quick responsiveness needs to consider many aspects 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝. See the below picture for details: 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬: 1. Less is more - less element on the web page, fewer data queries to the database, fewer web requests, fewer system dependencies 2.

We definitely don’t want to inform users that they have successfully placed orders but later tell them no items are actually available 156Back-of-the-envelope estimation Recently, a few engineers asked me whether we really need back-of-the-envelope estimation in a system design interview. I think it would be helpful to clarify. Estimations are important because we need them to understand the scale of the system and justify the design. It helps answer questions like: - Do we really need a distributed solution? - Is a cache layer necessary? - Shall we choose data replication or sharding? Here is an example of how the estimations shape the design decision. One interview question is to design proximity service and how to scale geospatial index is a key part of it. Here are a few paragraphs we wrote to show why jumping to a sharding design without estimations is a bad idea: “One common mistake about scaling the geospatial index is to quickly jump to a sharding scheme without considering the actual data size of the table. In our case, the full dataset for the geospatial index table is not large (quadtree index only takes 1.71G memory and storage requirement for geohash index is similar). The whole geospatial index can easily fit in the working set of a modern database server. However, depending on the read volume, a single database server might not have enough CPU or network bandwidth to service all read requests. If that is the case, it will be necessary to spread the read load among multiple database servers. There are two general approaches to spread the load of a relational database server. We can add read replicas or shard the database. Many engineers like to talk about sharding during interviews. However, it might not be a good fit for the geohash table. Sharding is complicated. The sharding logic has to be added to the application layer. Sometimes, sharding is the only option. In this case though, since everything can fit in the working set of a database server, there is no strong technical reason to shard the data among multiple servers. 157A better approach, in this case, is to have a series of read replicas to help with the read load. This method is much simpler to develop and maintain. Thus, we recommend scaling the geospatial index table through replicas.” — Check out our bestselling system design books.

If you\\'re intrigued by the advancements in language models and are eager to explore new tools that can enhance your applications, you\\'ve landed at the right place. In this comprehensive guide, we\\'ll unravel the mysteries of LangChain Document Loaders and show you how they can be a game-changer in your language model applications.\\nWhat is LangChain?\\nBefore we dive into the specifics of LangChain Document Loaders, let\\'s take a step back and understand what LangChain is. LangChain is a creative AI application that aims to address the limitations of language models like GPT-3.\\nLangChain\\'s unique approach to structuring documents makes it a preferred choice for developers and researchers alike. It provides a suite of tools that help structure documents for easy utilization with Language Model applications (LLMs). These tools include Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Vector Stores, and Retrievers.\\nDocument Loaders are responsible for loading documents into the LangChain system. They handle various types of documents, including PDFs, and convert them into a format that can be processed by the LangChain system. This process involves several steps, including data ingestion, context understanding, and fine-tuning. But what exactly are these Document Loaders, and how do they work? Let\\'s break it down:\\nWhat are LangChain Document Loaders?\\nIn LangChain, a Document is a simple structure with two fields:\\n\\n\\npage_content (string): This field contains the raw text of the document.\\n\\n\\nmetadata (dictionary): This field stores additional metadata about the text, such as the source URL, author, or any other relevant information.\\n\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s consider a text document named \"sample.txt\" with the following content:\\nWelcome to LangChain! This is an example document for understanding Document Loaders.\\nBy using the TextLoader, the content of the text file can be loaded into a Document as follows:\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\\n \\n# Load text data from a file using TextLoader\\nloader = TextLoader(\"./data/sample.txt\")\\ndocument = loader.load()\\nAfter loading, the Document structure would look like:\\n{\\n  \"page_content\": \"Welcome to LangChain! This is an example document for understanding Document Loaders.\",\\n  \"metadata\": {}\\n}\\nTypes of Document Loaders in LangChain\\nLangChain offers three main types of Document Loaders:\\n\\nTransform Loaders: These loaders handle different input formats and transform them into the Document format. For instance, consider a CSV file named \"data.csv\" with columns for \"name\" and \"age\". Using the CSVLoader, you can load the CSV data into Documents:\\n\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader\\n \\n# Load data from a CSV file using CSVLoader\\nloader = CSVLoader(\"./data/data.csv\")\\ndocuments = loader.load()\\n \\n# Access the content and metadata of each document\\nfor document in documents:\\n    content = document.page_content\\n    metadata = document.metadata\\n \\n    # Process the content and metadata\\n    # ...\\n}\\nEach row in the CSV file will be transformed into a separate Document with the respective \"name\" and \"age\" values.\\n\\nPublic Dataset or Service Loaders: LangChain provides loaders for popular public sources, allowing quick retrieval and creation of Documents. For example, the WikipediaLoader can load content from Wikipedia:\\n\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import WikipediaLoader\\n \\n# Load content from Wikipedia using WikipediaLoader\\nloader = WikipediaLoader(\"Machine_learning\")\\ndocument = loader.load()\\nThe WikipediaLoader retrieves the content of the specified Wikipedia page (\"Machine_learning\") and loads it into a Document.\\n\\nProprietary Dataset or Service Loaders: These loaders are designed to handle proprietary sources that may require additional authentication or setup. For instance, a loader could be created specifically for loading data from an internal database or an API with proprietary access.\\n\\nBy providing different types of Document Loaders, LangChain enables the loading of data from various sources into standardized Documents, facilitating the seamless integration of diverse data into the LangChain system.\\nUse Cases for LangChain Document Loaders\\nNow that we\\'ve understood the theory behind LangChain Document Loaders, let\\'s get our hands dirty with some code. In this section, we\\'ll walk you through some use cases that demonstrate how to use LangChain Document Loaders in your LLM applications.\\nExample 1: Create Indexes with LangChain Document Loaders\\nLet\\'s illustrate the role of Document Loaders in creating indexes with concrete examples:\\nStep 1. Chunking\\nConsider a long article about machine learning. The Document Loader breaks down the article into smaller chunks, such as paragraphs or sentences. Each chunk becomes a unit of information that can be indexed and processed individually. For instance:\\nOriginal Article:\\nIntroduction to Machine Learning\\n\\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence...\\n\\n[...]\\nChunked Document:\\nChunk 1: Introduction to Machine Learning\\nChunk 2: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence...\\n[...]\\nStep 2. Embeddings\\nThe Document Loader transforms each chunk of the document into an embedding, a numerical representation of its semantic meaning. For instance:\\nOriginal Chunk: \"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence...\"\\nEmbedding: [0.2, 0.7, -0.5, ...]\\nStep 3. Chains\\nThe embeddings are organized into chains, which represent sequences of related chunks. Chains capture the flow and context within the document. For instance:\\nChain: [Embedding1, Embedding2, Embedding3, ...]\\nSte 4. Memory Vectors\\nMemory vectors are generated based on the chains and embeddings. They provide additional context and information to language models. For instance:\\nMemory Vector: [0.5, -0.3, 0.1, ...]\\nBy creating indexes using Document Loaders, LangChain offers the following benefits:\\n\\n\\nEfficient Access: With the index, language models can quickly access specific chunks of the document, allowing for efficient processing and analysis.\\n\\n\\nContext Understanding: The structured index helps language models understand the context and relationships between different parts of the document. They can comprehend how concepts connect and refer back to previous information.\\n\\n\\nImproved Performance: Indexed documents enable faster retrieval and processing of information, leading to improved performance and reduced computational overhead.\\n\\n\\nEnhanced Usability: The structured index provides a well-organized framework that developers and researchers can easily navigate and utilize within their language model applications.\\n\\n\\nExample 2: Data Ingestion with LangChain Document Loaders\\nLangChain Document Loaders excel in data ingestion, allowing you to load documents from various sources into the LangChain system. For instance, suppose you have a text file named \"sample.txt\" containing text data. You can use the TextLoader to load the data into LangChain:\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\\n \\n# Load text data from a file using TextLoader\\nloader = TextLoader(\"./data/sample.txt\")\\ndocument = loader.load()\\nIn this example, the TextLoader loads the content of the text file and returns a Document object. You can then access the page_content field of the Document to work with the loaded data.\\nExample 3： Context Understanding with LangChain Document Loaders\\nLangChain Document Loaders enhance context understanding by parsing documents and extracting relevant information. Let\\'s consider a CSV file named \"sample.csv\" containing data in tabular form. You can use the CSVLoader to load and extract data from the CSV file:\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader\\n \\n# Load data from a CSV file using CSVLoader\\nloader = CSVLoader(\"./data/sample.csv\")\\ndocuments = loader.load()\\n \\n# Access the content and metadata of each document\\nfor document in documents:\\n    content = document.page_content\\n    metadata = document.metadata\\n \\n    # Process the content and metadata\\n    # ...\\nIn this example, the CSVLoader reads the CSV file and returns a list of Document objects, each representing a row in the CSV. You can access the page_content and metadata fields of each Document to work with the loaded data and its associated metadata.\\nExample 4: Fine-tuning with LangChain Document Loaders\\nLangChain Document Loaders also contribute to the fine-tuning process of language models. For example, suppose you have a Pandas DataFrame named dataframe containing structured data. You can use the PandasDataFrameLoader to load the data into LangChain:\\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import PandasDataFrameLoader\\n \\n# Load data from a Pandas DataFrame using PandasDataFrameLoader\\nloader = PandasDataFrameLoader(dataframe)\\ndocuments = loader.load()\\n \\n# Access the content and metadata of each document\\nfor document in documents:\\n    content = document.page_content\\n    metadata = document.metadata\\n \\n    # Fine-tune the model using the content and metadata\\n    # ...\\nIn this example, the PandasDataFrameLoader takes the DataFrame as input and returns a list of Document objects. You can access the page_content and metadata fields of each Document to fine-tune the language model using the loaded data.\\nThese examples demonstrate how LangChain Document Loaders work in practice. They handle the loading of documents from different sources, enhance context understanding through parsing, and facilitate the fine-tuning process. By leveraging these loaders, you can effectively structure documents for LLMs and maximize the potential of the LangChain platform.\\nReal-World Applications for LangChain Document Loaders\\nLet\\'s look at some potential real-world use cases of how to use LangChain Document Loaders.\\nBuild a ChatGPT App for PDFs with LangChain\\nIn addition to loading and parsing PDF files, LangChain can be utilized to build a ChatGPT application specifically tailored for PDF documents.

      "[Document(page_content=\"E3 AI getting hit in early morning  trading on Thursday in response to the  company's disappointing earnings results  here's everything you need to know about  this business in about 10 minutes my  name is Brian faldi as the time is  recording I do not own shares of C3 AI  ticker shimble AI a $3.5 billion company  Revenue this quarter grew 177% that was  an acceleration to 73.2 million however  that missed wall Street's estimate  although was within the midpoint of  Management's guidance range uh earnings  per share on an adjusted basis were -13  cents that was worse than the year ago  period although was better than wall  Street's uh estimate mixed results at  best but the disappointing Revenue  guidance is not a good sign for  investors uh margins are horrible  horrible across the board down on a  gross operating and net margin basis  we'll get to why this is happening in  just a little bit free cash flow year to  date year-to dates so for the last six  months essentially uh were negative 62  million that was an improvement from the  year ago period but still this company  is consuming cash uh net income was  roughly flat year- overy year not a good  number there and the balance sheet has  is in great shape that's the only really  great financial thing you can say about  this company excellent balance sheet but  that number is dwindling uh make no  mistake about that now stock based  compensation remains quite high at this  business $53 million in stock-based  compensation this quarter that compares  to 73 million in Revenue that is a huge  amount of stock-based compensation  that's going right out the door uh to  employees and shareholders are feeling  that pain 9% almost 10% growth in the um  diluted share count for this company  year over-year so this is a company that  is heavily diluting its shareholders  through stock based compensation now  what's up with those margins and what's  up with the slow uh Revenue growth rate  it really boils down to this the company  recently transitioned from subscription  based pricing to consumption braed  pricing uh this puts them more in line  with their peers like uh snowflake um  but this transition uh has a nasty side  effect where it reduces the company's  Revenue growth rate and it also makes  the company's margins uh much lower at  least in the near term so management  believes that this move will pay off in  the long term because they are betting  big on the uses of AI really  accelerating but this is a big cause of  the company's Financial Wows uh right  now now in other news they did close 62  new agreements during the quarter  including 36 pilot agreements so they  are signing on new uh new new customers  importantly they're doing so with the  help of their Partners so they've  partnered with Amazon Baker Hughes Booze  Allen Google and Microsoft and more and  these Partnerships are leading to new uh  New Deals moreover the company continues  to expand its Partnerships with Amazon  uh web web services and their pilot uh  program seems to be going uh quite well  they had uh 62 uh agreements in total 36  of which were were pilots that was a  nice increase um from the first quarter  of the year ago so this this starts to  um it looks like it's it's uh it's  taking off uh for uh for the business  and their qu their list of qualified  pipeline uh potential candidates  continues to grow uh quite rapidly so  this remains an exciting area for the  company to uh to invest in now on the  call with investors CEO and founder  Thomas seel basically said that customer  engagements continue to grow very  rapidly uh year over over year but the  decision to switch to consumption based  pricing is causing um some headaches  from a financial uh per perspective  although Revenue growth did accelerate  this quarter but in North America 28%  growth which is the Lion Share of  Revenue but look at this Europe Middle  East and Africa 11% decrease um in in in  Revenue 11% decrease so North America  continues to look quite good uh Amia not  so good um uh over overall  and again they did he did point out on  the call that basically everything is  being hit right now due to that switch  to consumption based pricing turning to  guidance management is guiding for 76  million-ish in Revenue in the upcoming  quarter below what Wall Street was  expecting another reason why Shares are  taking a dive in early morning trading  for the full year they left their  revenue guidance unchanged Wall Street  is still expecting 308 million in in  Revenue that's slightly above so not  great news on the Revenue guidance uh  pers per perspective here's something  that should irk investors uh when they  initially initial uh gave guidance for  this fiscal year they were calling for  295 million in Revenue 295 to 320  million in revenue and losses of about  you know 50 to 75 million uh three  months later here is their updated uh  guidance same Revenue guidance but they  increased their nonoperating loss from  operations guidance so hey we're going  to make same out of Revenue but we're  going to spend more money this quarter  they updated this guidance to this  number almost 125 million in non-gaap  operating losses same Revenue so they  think revenue is not going to be  trending any higher than the initially  thought but their expenses are basically  double double over the last two quarters  what they thought just just six months  ago so I understand why Wall Street is  is not happy with this company uh today  uh overall here I think that investors  in this business should watch Revenue  margins free cash flow and importantly  that delution rate I think the moat here  is you know stable maybe widening a  little bit if you're if you're generous  and the thes is mostly on track that  switch to consumption based pricing is  putting some downward pressure on all  the companies financials right now so  there is that to uh to keep in mind now  thinking about valuation for a spec for  a second c3i is basically optimized for  Revenue sort of optimized for gross  profit but nothing else is is optimized  so when we think where is the company on  the business growth cycle it is  somewhere in phase two it should be  growing at a hyper growth rate but it's  kind of going backwards in that  perspective because of that shift to  consumption based pricing for that  reason valuing this company is going to  be particularly uh tricky the only  multiples that we really have access to  as investors are essentially price to  sales and price to gross profit so let's  take a look at both of those using the  sponsor of today's video uh which is why  charts a tool that we love and use uh  basically every day here is C3 dei's  market cap over the last uh since it  since it came public in 2021 you can see  that at some points this was basically a  17 billion doll market cap company just  insanely valued and that basically fell  all the way down to one just over1  billion do more recently it's about $3  billion um in in in market cap so wild  ride now if we compare that to gross  profit today uh this company is trading  at about 16 or 17 times gross profit  very high in absolute uh terms uh the  story on a price to sales basis is just  as bad this company at one point was  trading at 77 77 times sales uh  currently uh 10 times sales got down to  as low as four times sales 10 times  sales is a very high number in absolute  terms and boy is that pricing in a huge  amount of growth uh still uh so very  high on a price to sale on price to  gross profit basis uh PE uh price to  free cash flow those are all useless to  us the company has no earnings it has no  free cash flow so those numbers don't  really help so on a pure multiple  perspective uh the numbers Clearly say  this company is extremely richly uh  valued right now uh if you want to give  y charts a try uh there is a link in the  video description and you can use my  name at checkout to save 20% thank you  to Y charts for sponsoring this video  now that is one way to measure a company  that's in the hypergrowth phase uh  another way is UN using what's called  earnings power as a quick refresher  here's what that means basically right  now the company has no profits at all  because it is spending and reinvesting  in itself like crazy earnings power asks  the questions how much profit could this  business be earning today if instead of  focusing on growth it focused on profits  and net income to do so we have to  estimate what is this company's ultimate  net margin uh profile that it could be  operating at scale uh here are some  businesses that represent different uh  net margins um out there in the world  given that this is a software as a  service company with a 60-ish percent  maybe even 78% gross margin in time I  don't think it's ridiculous to assume  that this company could ultimately be  producing 20 to 25% uh earnings uh net  profit uh margin so if we use this  little calculator that we have here and  we put in the company's ticker symbol AI  trailing 12-month Revenue about 275  million and we assume that this company  could produce an earnings power profit  margin in time of 25% uh this company is  trading at about 46 times adjusted  earnings today 46 times pretend uh  earnings if you will uh and even that  number is is it means that investors are  pricing in quite a bit of Revenue growth  from here even if they and they're  assuming they get to that 25% uh gross  um net income margin now could that net  in margin be higher uh if so um this  number this number might be more  reasonable could this net income number  uh be lower sure and this company would  be even more expensive today uh to me no  matter how you slice it this company is  priced at a very high multiple uh for  that reason I personally have no  interest in owning this stock the  dilution way too high it's far away uh  from from profits and while it has an  awesome ticker and an awesome a bull  casee thesis I would want to see much  higher Revenue growth rate before I  would ever consider touching this stock  given where it is valued at this point I  hope that you found this review to be  useful if so please give it a like and  let me know in the comment section below

      "[Document(page_content=\"database provider mongod DB released  earnings last night and shares are down  as much as 6% following that release so  what does this mean for shareholders and  was it that bad of a report my name is  Brian stoel will'll spend the next 10  minutes trying to figure that out we  also try and figure out if it's finally  reached mongodb evaluation that might  make some consider investing in it uh at  the time of this recording I do own  shares of mongodb and want to give a  shout out to Y charts for sponsoring  today's video more from them in just a  bit so this was mongodb's fiscal third  quarter of 2024 yes they have a weird  calendar 2024 about a$ 30 billion  company Revenue grew 30% well ahead of  both wall Street's and Management's  guidance on the top line and on the  bottom line a lot to like on a non-gaap  mostly because of stock-based  compensation basis the company uh more  than tripled its earnings per share  share pretty much quadrupled it to 96  cents that was pretty much double what  Wall Street in management had expected  we'll get to why they did that in just a  minute it's worth noting that Atlas  Revenue mongodb Atlas revenue is up 36%  year-over-year and now accounts for  2third of total revenue if we look at  some of the key numbers total customers  was up 19% direct sales 177% those are  usually larger customers those using  Atlas which is pretty pretty much the  entirety of the total customers was up  19% and then customers with over  $100,000 in Revenue was up 28% so all in  all pretty good it is worth noting that  when you see customers up about 19% and  yet revenue is up 30% that's got to mean  that those existing customers were  paying more over year-over year and  we'll get to that truth in just a second  they said that net AR expansion rate was  over 120% which means existing customers  are using 20% more that is a great sign  let's look at margins all on a on Gap  basis gross margins expanded  meaningfully while operating in net  margins more than tripled uh that is a  very good sign free cash flow went from  a loss to a gain of 36 million same  Dynamics with net income pretty solid  balance sheet with about $800 million  net cash now if we look at the company's  income statement this includes  stock-based compensation but it still  shows the overall Dynamics which is  total revenue growing 30% but the cost  of that Revenue only growing 14% that's  a great sign revenue is growing twice as  fast as the cost of Revenue is this is  scaling that happens with the  cloud-based business therefore gross  profit grows even faster at 36% uh even  faster than that if you take out stock  based compensation same thing happened  with operating expenses it only grew 15%  while while Revenue was up 30% when that  happens then in this case it's a loss  from operations Narrows by 15% now it is  worth pointing out that stock-based  compensation is still significant about  27% of Revenue which leads to a 3.9%  delution rate which should not be  ignored that's not nothing when the  company came out with guidance there was  a lot to like re uh Revenue guidance for  the current quarter is for 19% growth  while uh while Street was just expecting  15% also earnings per share is ahead of  wall Street's guidance and for the full  year which pretty much just includes the  next quarter uh mongodb is calling for  29% growth while Wall Street was just  expecting 25% more than tripling of  earnings per share on a non-gaap basis  that's better than Wall Street was  expecting so I'm a shareholder myself  what am I going to be watching first is  those $100,000 total customers they as  they get more customers that means that  they're winning over workloads and  that's important number two is atlas  Revenue number three is those operating  margins going to look at that both on a  non-gaap and a gap basis and number four  is free cash flow there is no doubt that  the moat is widening and the thesis is  very much on track for owning this  company which is why it scores so well  on both Brian Fry's and my checklist um  but we've got to turn to valuation now  and for that we head on over to Y charts  a tool that Brian froley and I use every  single day if you would like a free  trial of white charts click the link in  the show notes below mention Brian Fry's  name and you'll get 20% off so we've got  to consider where in the growth cycle is  mongodb we know that they're free cash  flow positive even if on a gap basis  they're over here so I would say they're  somewhere in this range which means that  we can check out things like grow price  to gross profit forward earnings in free  cash flow so if we start with gross  profit it's been growing nicely uh uh  with with a market cap of about $30  billion and about 1.2 billion in gross  profit this is trading for 25 times  gross profit that is an expensive  valuation if we look at its forward PE  ratio of about 185 while that's  meaningfully less than it has been in  the past that is still extremely  expensive and we don't get much help  with the price to free cash flow either  because the free cash flow is so low the  important thing is that this is at the  very least in the sell funding area they  don't need to rely on Wall Street to  raise money anymore uh via uh stock  offerings so the question then becomes  well how expensive is this stock is this  worth holding on look it's important to  remember that eight months ago mongodb  came out with earnings and I said this  is absolutely wonderful earnings the  stock Dove and it fell to about $194 per  share and I said if I didn't already own  5% of it I'd be backing up the truck  that was just eight months ago and that  has played out well because the company  has more than doubled since then but has  it gotten ahead of itself well here's  how I like to think about that and I  think it's really important what I like  to do is do a reverse discounted cash  flow model now this is a tool that Brian  froley Brian Withers and I have built  and you can get a free copy of it by  clicking in the link in the show notes  below but what you have to do is just  put the company's ticker symbol in there  put in its free cash flow over the  trailing 12 months in this case $88  million that's it we'll give it a 2%  terminal growth growth rate 10% discount  rate just means it would match the  Market's returns and right now cuz the  market hasn't opened it this is really  trading for about let's say $400 so we  want this to equal $400 and when we do  the math I mean oh man this really has  to grow fast  49% for a decade is what free cash flow  has to grow by so like full stop and  let's talk about that 49% growth in free  cash flow for a full decade that is some  richly valued company however it is  worth considering this right now mongodb  just has a 5.5 free cash flow margin  which means that only five and a half  cents of every dollar that comes in  becomes free cash flow will it be that  way forever no it won't my best guess is  it could reach as much as 30 cents for  every dollar becomes free cash flow and  so what that means is if it's at 5% and  it could go to 30% that means that free  cash flow could grow six times six times  faster than revenue does and if that's  the case well then maybe this isn't so  ridiculous so let's head back to this  and I'll show you another way of looking  at this okay so if that were the case if  it had a 30% free cash flow margin that  would give the company roughly $500  million in free cash flow right now and  so whatever this is this is going to  tells how much revenue needs to grow  over the next 10 years cuz we're  assuming that it's optimized now  obviously it's not going to be 49%  that's a crazy high number what about  30% no that's still really high we want  this to be about $400 what if we knock  it down to 20 now we're getting closer  maybe 23 so 23% so what we're saying is  mongodb needs to grow its Topline by 23%  for a full decade in order to justify  today's price the company's expected to  grow its Topline by about 25% over the  next two years now it's worth noting  because this is a usage based product  its growth rates actually can decelerate  and accelerate it's not like a standard  subscription based business where it's  kind of like a slow sloping down because  it's usage based it can go up and down  but I'll admit this is a company that uh  now accounts for about 8 to 9% of my own  portfolio and while I said when it was  at $194 it was no way I was going to  sell this is something I'm considering  selling now now selling all of it  absolutely not this is incredibly  antifragile business I am not doing that  but what I might consider is reducing my  position to about 5% so that if a better  opportunity comes I can use that extra  cash if I sell soon so that I can buy a  little bit more I know that's a  Divergence from where I've been in the  past but I've learned lessons the hard  way about valuation and applying them  I'm certainly not going to sell out of  mongodb altogether this is a great  company but it is worth looking at the  valuation now I hope that helped we'll  check back in on this one in 90 days  until then Brian  out\", metadata={'source': 'qN-CkIesiOM', 'title': 'MongoDB OBLITERATED Expectations!

      "[Document(page_content=\"data software specialist snowflake  reported earnings last night and the  stock is Off to the Races up almost 10%  in pre-market trading so what happened  in this quarter and is this an  absolutely ridiculous valuation I mean  on the face of it trading for 252 times  forwards earnings 95 times free cash  flow 23 times sales by all traditional  metrics you should stay away from  Snowflake Lake but I intend to show that  not only did the company perform  excellently during the quarter but that  the valuation might be far more  reasonable than you might think my name  is Brian stoel we'll figure all that out  over the next 10 minutes as of the time  of this recording I do own shares of  snowflake want to give a shout out to Y  charts for sponsoring today's video more  from them in just a minute so confusing  calendar here this is snowflakes third  quarter of yes 2024 they have a weird  calendar it's going to be about a round  a $62 billion company on the top line  revenue grew 32% to 734 million that was  ahead of Wall Streets estimates  management gives guidance for their  product Revenue they don't worry so much  about their service revenue and they  came in well ahead of their forecast so  they beat there as well on the bottom  line non-gaap earnings per share more  than doubled to 27 cents per share also  ahead of wall Street's estimates we look  at margins round to the nearest whole  number gross margins expanded very very  nicely to 75% operating and net margins  both expanded as well all on a non-gap  basis free cash flow increased from 65  million to 102 million net income  increased as well and the balance sheet  is pretty perfect with $4.5 billion  dollars in cash and Investments on hand  and no long-term debt to speak of so  let's look at what happened during the  quarter uh there was some operating  leverage at the company realized but not  as as much as it has in quarters past we  see that sales and marketing fell as a  percentage of Revenue and so did General  administrat however their spending on  research and development actually  expanded that doesn't bother me because  this is investments in the company's  future and with the Advent of AI and  chat GPT the uses for this technology  are expanding now it is worth noting if  you own shares of this company  stock-based compensation is a very real  thing almost $300 million during the  quarter it's about 41% of Revenue that's  a lot it's worth stating that's less  than it was as a percentage of Revenue  in the previous quarters but it is still  a lot and that leads to about 2.8%  delution that is about the same rate of  delution that we were at at the same  time three months ago now moving on to  news for the company total customers  were up 24% to almost 9,000 and the  number of customers spending at least a  million dollar grew 52% now 436 of them  on board now this is important remaining  performance obligations um it's  important to just kind of review the way  that snowflake works the best way that I  like is it's kind of like going to your  county fair where you pay a bunch of  money at a booth and you get tickets in  return and then you submit those tickets  to take the ride snowflake in very crude  way is very similar where companies pay  a whole bunch of money and then they run  queries on their data and when they run  those queries that's like turning in the  tickets and that's when Revenue gets  realized but remaining performance  obligations is more like keeping track  of how much money has gone into the  booth where you get the tickets from and  that's why it's a really important  indicator now on that on that note what  we saw happen was remaining performance  obligations is actually only up 23% less  than Revenue now part of that might be  concern earning but it's worth pointing  out that other usage based products like  mongodb have called out that they are  willing to forego those longer contracts  and try and and get customers to spend  more moving forward by letting them just  pay as they go so that Dynamic is there  and you can already see that because if  you just look at the amount of remaining  performance obligations that the company  expects to realize within the next 12  months that actually jumped 27% so  something to keep your eye on if there's  one weak part of this this would be it  but not a huge problem the company's net  revenue retention rate remains Best in  Class at 135% it is coming down but  remember what this means it means that  the company is not only holding on to  all of its customers but on average it's  getting its customers to spend 35% more  that is a fantastic Dynamic uh it's also  worth pointing out that the number of C  customers that have at least one stable  Edge in other words they're sharing  their data in the snowflake Marketplace  is now at 28% and the number of listings  of those is up to 2,300 that's up 9%  quarter on quarter and I think it's  worth pointing that out because there  are high switching costs with snowflake  but the use of these stable edges and  knowing that you can only buy data from  other companies and sell it to other  companies if you're on the snowflake  platform introduces another weaker but  important Mo in the form of network  effects so that is also worth watching  and in my opinion very very encouraging  this company is a high quality company  and it showed when the company uh uh  gave its guidance for the quarter ahead  that we're in right now they called for  718 million now that might look like  it's below Wall Street Testament but  it's actually above because remember  they only talk about their product  Revenue at the Mido 700 118 million  that's 29% growth year-over-year Wall  Street was expecting 26% year over-year  so what should investors watch moving  forward first that net revenue retention  we want to see it remain above  120% for the next couple of quarters  number two $1 million customers we want  to see that number continue to grow by  at least 30% for the foreseeable future  stable Edge customers and listings for  that secondary Network effect we want to  see that continue to grow and then check  back in on that RPO that is an important  number remaining performance obligations  the moat is no doubt widening around  this business the thesis is very very  much on track so this is a high quality  company that scores very well on my  investing framework so it should be no  surprise why it is a stock that I own  but now let's turn to valuation now  remember for me the quality of the  company it's anti fragility is 80% of  the equation the other 20% is valuation  and on here I actually think that this  stock might be much more affordable or  at least not as ridiculously priced as  you might think now first we've got to  ask ourselves where is it in the uh  growth cycle and I would say somewhere  between stages three and four and so  there's some metrics we can look at and  for that we go to Y charts it's a tool  that Brian fry and I use every day if  you'd like to join us and using it every  day click the link on the show notes  below mention Brian Fry's name and  you'll get 20% off of your subscription  so we head on over and we see that  snowflakes doesn't have a trailing PE  ratio on a gap basis on a forward basis  it's  252 now that might be lower than it's  been at any point in the past year or  two it is still a ridiculously high  number so very expensive if we look at  gross profit and add in what we saw uh  over the previous quarter what we see is  that it's trading for about 35 times  gross profit and if we look at free cash  flow it's trading at about 95 times free  cash flow no matter how you slice this  extremely extremely expensive this would  be like a stay away from it type of  stock for many investors however we can  also use a reverse discounted cash flow  model to figure out what we think of it  and for this tool this is a tool that  Brian fry Brian Withers and I built  ourselves now if you disagree with any  input that I am putting into it for  snowflake you can simply download copy  of this absolutely free and input your  own numbers just click the link in the  show notes below here's what I'm going  to do to just kind of run us through how  this works what you first do is you put  in the ticker symbol right here SN W put  in trailing free cash flow so about $632  million I'm going to put in a terminal  growth rate of 2% a discount rate of 10%  now you might say well I want a market  feeder it should be 11 or 12% you can do  that um that's just the getting the  market average return over the next  decade I'm saying 10% uh and then we  just have to go until these two prices  match now it's worth noting that this  will likely jump to about  $190 once the Market opens so I'll just  change that but now I just play with  this until they match so 25 I'm going to  have to go up to 30  31% so somewhere between 30 and 31% the  stock has to grow in order order its  free cash flow over the next 10 years in  order to justify today's price now that  might seem like a lot especially because  the top line is expected to grow by 31%  over the next few years but keeping that  up for a decade might be really hard  however there's another wrinkle to add  in there and that's that this company's  free cash flow margin or the percent of  Revenue that it turns into free cash  flow is still not optimized and  management says it should reach 30% by  2029 so if we go back and we assume that  30% of its revenue is free cash flow  that changes things a little bit because  then free cash flow would be about 800  million and then this growth rate could  actually come down to about  28 maybe  26 somewhere around 27 um depending on  where the stock opens today so 27% now  that is still a high number but think of  it this way you have a usage based  software product in the age of AI that  needs to grow assuming it gets a 30%  free cash flow margin it needs to grow  its Revenue by about 27% per year for 10  years very high hurdle but the company  is expected to it grow at 31% pretty  consistently over the next couple of  years and if it can do that or it can  eek out more than 30% free cash flow  margin well then you've got Market  beating potential to me that means that  it's actually quite reasonable reable  and if I had to put it uh somewhere on a  spectrum I would say it lands somewhere  right here not a screaming by by any  stretch of the imagination but I don't  think it's quite as expensive as people  think and no matter what you think of  the valuation there's no doubt that this  is a very high quality company sure  going to get some people that might  disagree with that valuation take  probably a lot less when it comes to the  company quality take but you can let me  know what you think in the show notes  below and we'll check back in on this  one in 90 days until then Brian  out\", metadata={'source': 'OOnuUFn2FZ4', 'title': 'Why Snowflake Stock is Actually CHEAPER Than You Think | $SNOW Earnings Analysis', 'description': 'Unknown',

      "[Document(page_content=\"shares of crowd strike up a few percent  in early morning trading on Wednesday in  response to the company's upbeat  quarterly results what happened this  quarter with crowd strike here's  everything you need to know in about 10  minutes my name is Brian fry as of the  Tim is recording I do own shares of  crowd strike a $51 billion company  Revenue this quarter was 786 million of  35% easily exceeding wall Street's  estimate and Management's own guidance  earnings per share similar story more  than doubled from a year ago period on  an adjusted basis also beating estimates  and Management's guidance annualized  recurring Revenue eclipsed $3 billion  this quarter and grew 35% nice strong  growth there one thing that irked me  probably the only flaw that I saw in  this company's quarterly report is that  they are no longer reporting on this  chart the dollar-based net revenue  retention rate this is a chart from a  couple of quarters uh ago uh so they did  not include this in their slides why  well they said that their gross  retention remains high and their dollar  based retention rate was slightly below  our Benchmark their Benchmark is 120 so  we can see that that number is coming  down now they didn't give us an exact  number we can infer 118 117% something  like that never a good look when a  management team stops reporting a key  metric but other than that there's not  much to complain about here margins for  the quarter were excellent gross  operating a net margin all up  year-over-year net margin here on a  non-gaap basis was almost up a thousand  basis points to  25.3% outstanding operating leverage  there free cash flow production was  strong at 239 million net income this is  on a gap basis swung to a positive  number $27 million this quarter even  accounting for all the effects of  stock-based compensation up from a loss  in the year ago period balance sheet  looking pristine 3.1 billion in cash 742  million in debt digging into the  company's income statement a little bit  more we saw nice growth uh in total  revenue on both subscription and  Professional Services gross profit here  was growing faster thanks to that gross  margin expansion expenses were up across  the board no surprise there given that  this company is in growth mode net  income did swing from a loss uh to a  positive number now stock base  compensation remains high at this  business 159 million in total  stock-based compensation up  year-over-year thankfully the delusion  on a percentage basis isn't too bad the  non-gaap dilution the non-gaap uh  dilution ra is about 1.5% Gap it's a  little bit higher call it 3% those are  just the price of investing uh In Crowd  strike this business is growing it's  hiring great talents and it is using  stock based compensation to attract them  digging into some of the news for the  quarter we saw that the module adoption  rates continue uh to increase 63% of  customers now have at least five modules  there up from the quarter ago period  this company is doing a fabulous job of  upselling its customers they also  achieved a perfect 100% coverage score  in protection visibility and analytical  detection on this evaluations test they  were the industry's first company to do  so they also exceeded 1 billion in Cloud  sales through Amazon web services and  announced a handful of new products for  small and large businesses and they made  a small acquisition to continue to build  out their product stack now one thing  that management did note that they are  investing in their investment and data  centers and that is helping to uh  causing the record gross margin results  that we saw so nice to see that those  Investments are paying off they also  noted that  62% of their new customers were partner  sourced so their decision to work with  others is really helping to bring in new  customers turning to guidance one reason  why Shares are up in uh in response to  this report is mostly due to the upbeat  guidance management is guiding for 33%  Revenue growth in the upcoming quarter  ahead of estimates and about 82 cents in  earnings per share also ahead of  estimates similar story for the full  year Management guid in for revenue of  about 3.04 eight billion also ahead of  wall Street's estimate almost $3 in  earnings per share on an adjusted basis  also ahead of estimates this number is  almost double what it was in the year  ago period so very strong uh  profitability and revenue forecast for  uh this business now management did say  on the call that they are on path to  achieve $10 billion in annualized  recurring Revenue and they increased  their target operating margin uh margin  uh profile so there is continued uh  upside potential in their margins which  is quite remarkable this company is  guiding for long-term free cash flow  margins over  34% just  outstanding now they also gave a  timeline here they expect to achieve  these margins in the next three to five  years and10 billion in annualized  recurring Revenue in the next five to  7even years 10 billion  that is a big number but management  issued this slide and they think the  current market opportunity for them is  about 100 billion and that number is  expected to grow according to management  to 225 billion over the next couple  years take all of these numbers with a  massive grain of salt management  obviously has a huge incentive to make  them look inflated but $10 billion in  annualized recurring Revenue compared to  this opportunity showcases that the  number is at least possible to achieve  overall here the thesis for this company  is fully on track keep an eye on new  customers multiproduct usage free cash  flow and net new annualize your curring  Revenue the moat here clearly widening  the thesis very much on track and it  continues to score very well on both  mine and Brian stl's investing framework  turning to valuation this company is  optimized uh on the income statement on  a non-gaap basis so we would put it  somewhere between stages four and stages  five on the business cycle growth chart  for that reason we can use its current  multiples to draw conclusions about its  valuation so let's take a look at some  of those multiples using the sponsor of  today's video which is why charts so  heading over to why charts we're going  to start with the company's market cap  currently about 51 52 uh billion dollars  up almost double more than double from  where it was earlier this year you can  see that the enthusiasm for the stock  has come back gross profit is about $2  billion compare that to the company's  market cap about 54 trading at about 27  times gross profit very very high  similar story from a price to sales  perspective over 20 times uh price to  sales this number got as low as about 11  still itself a very high uh absolute  number you can see that the valuation  has come down over the last couple of  years but 20 times sales an extremely  high number that is pricing in a lot of  growth now there isn't a trailing price  to earnings ratio to look at but there  is a forward one trading about 80 times  forward uh earnings and on a price to  free cash flow basis probably the metric  I would put the most emphasis on uh that  we've seen here is about 67 times uh  priced to free cash flow basis so that  is pricing in a heck of a lot of growth  earlier this year when uh nobody wanted  to invest in tech stocks this number got  down to about 36 37 uh that would be a  valuation that would be much more  enticing to me if we saw crowd strikes  valuation a got below there but you can  see just how useful it is to use a tool  like y charts to look at these numbers  over time so you can get the idea of  whether the valuation on a relative  basis is high or low so thank you to Y  charts for sponsoring this video if you  want to check out y charts there is a  link in the video description to get a  free trial and you can use my name at  checkout to save uh on your purchase  moving on we can also take a look at  this company's valuation using a reverse  discounted cash flow calculator so let's  do so using the tool that we built put  the company's ticker symbol in here the  free cash flow on a trailing 12 Monon  basis is about 950 million 2% terminal  growth rate 10% discount rate I  calculate that you have to get to about  22 is% growth 22 and a half percent  growth to justify uh today's today's  price tag so the price tag is currently  225 so my model says 22 more than 22%  free cash flow growth over the next 10  years is what the current is currently  being priced in uh to this stock so do  you think these numbers are a achievable  do you think that this company could be  producing about 7 billion in free cash  flow uh 10 years from now well keep in  mind there will be a little bit of  margin improvements that helps us to get  there but a lot of that number is going  to have to come from revenue growth so  Wall Street is absolutely pricing in  even at this size and scale 20% plus  Revenue growth for this business uh  moving forward so if you hope to  outperform that 10% threshold the  company has to grow even faster than  than that now I own this stock and I do  think that that is in the realm of  possibility but given the premium  valuation it's training at I would not  personally be interested in adding to my  position although this remains a very  very high quality name and I understand  why it's priced the way that it is hope  you enjoyed this review if you did give  this video a like it really helps us out  on YouTube see you in 90 days on this  one Brian out\", metadata={'source': '8IyTyyC43Dg', 'title':

      "[Document(page_content=\"imagine this scenario with me for a  minute you go into a classroom of  college students you tell them there's a  $ 1.2 trillion company that is growing  its Topline by over 200% it is doubling  its profit margins it is Raising its  Outlook moving forward first of all that  is something that no company of this  size has ever done before but then you  tell them after all these great results  come in after they raise the Outlook the  stock is down on the news yes that's  actually what happened first time that a  company at this scale has done this and  shares of Nvidia which reported its  earnings last night are actually down  over 3% as of right now so why is this  happening and what does it mean for  investors we'll get into that over the  next 10 minutes my name is Brian stoel  as of the time of this recording I do  not own shares of Nvidia want to give a  shout out to why charts for sponsoring  today's video more from them in just a  minute this was nvidia's thirdd quarter  of fiscal 20 24 yes they have a weird  calendar it's about a $1.2 trillion  company Revenue more than tripled to 18  billion which was ahead of wall Street's  and Management's guidance earnings per  share on a non-gaap basis more than 7x  to $48 again on a onget basis ahead of  wall Street's estimate so how did the  company pull off a tripling of Revenue  when it's already at such an incredible  scale here's how data center Revenue was  almost quadrupled from the same time  last year when you think about how this  happened let's just put this in context  it was about a year ago that chat GPT  was first released and it's pretty clear  that companies all over the world are  trying to use this technology and embed  it within their own companies and their  own technology and they are going by and  large to Nvidia for chips to help do  this for their data centers not to be  outdone the gaming uh segment did well  up 81% professional visualization a much  much smaller part was is also more than  doubled now let's look at these margins  of course the gross margin expanding is  probably the most important thing but  operating a net margins more than  doubled this is a$1 trillion company  that's doing about20 billion in business  next this quarter and it has a net  profit margin on a non-gap basis of over  55% absurd free cash flow went from a  slight loss to A7 billion gain net  income followed the same Dynamics the  balance sheet has over 8 billion in net  cash now how did the company do all this  well we already talked about why Revenue  more than triple but look at this on a  tripling of Revenue the cost of that  revenue is only up 71% the what they had  to pay for to make these chips now  that's great because while 71% jump in  cost of Revenue might be problematic on  an absolute basis it's a great thing  when revenue is more than tripling it  means that gross profit more than  quadruples but if you're ready for the  real coup here it is operating expenses  only up 16% Full Stop tripling in  Revenue operating expenses only need to  go up 16% to get there that is operating  leverage it's also what causes operating  income to 17x year-over year and net  income to 14x year-over year shares  outstanding actually went down speaking  of that uh this is should be no surprise  the main reason for that is that  language learning model startups  internet companies Global cloud service  providers were the first adopters for  these chips now we've got Nations we've  got enterprise software companies adding  Ai co-pilots and assistance to their  platforms that's where demand is coming  from during the third quarter it's worth  looking at what this company is doing  with all this cash return four billion  to shareholders most of that because of  share repurchases a small amount via  cash dividends now look at guidance  management said that it expects at the  midpoint $20 billion in Revenue during  the fourth quarter that's more than  tripling where it was last year it's  also over $2 billion doar more what Wall  Street was expecting that is good news  now what should investors watch moving  forward first Revenue just when it's  tripling just it's going to slow  eventually it's just a matter of how  quickly it slows second most of that is  coming from data centers so keep your  eye on the data centers third gross  margins if the company can keep it gross  margins over 70% that's a great sign  fourth Capital return this company is  now a cash machine and you want to know  what Management's doing to reward you as  a shareholder with that no doubt the  mode around this company is widening the  thesis is very much on track and it  scores very well on both of our  Frameworks so given all this amazing  News why is the stock down so much in a  word valuation let me show you what I  mean uh and for that we will go to Y  charts and Y charts is a tool that Brian  froley and I use every day if you would  like to start a free trial of Y charts  simply click on the link in the show  notes below mention Brian fy's name and  you will get 20% off of your uh  subscription so if we look at nvidia's  PE ratio before today was 120 after  those earnings are digested into the  system and if we consider it on a  non-gaap basis it's 61 but look 61 one  is still expensive on an absolute basis  and it's pretty expensive compared to  everywhere Nvidia has been before the  pandemic if we look at the Ford p ratio  of 45 that's more reasonable but still  quite expensive if you look you could  have gotten it for as below 25 uh at the  beginning of the year now it's priced to  free cash flow it was 120 times free  cash flow before earnings now it's about  70 but again 70 is still expensive on an  absolute basis and it is still expensive  in terms of nvidia's last 10 years so  all that's worth remembering we could  also go over and do a reverse discounted  cash flow model now this is a tool that  Brian froley Brian Withers and I have  created if you'd like a copy of this you  can click the link on the show notes  below and input your own numbers if you  disagree with the numbers that I'm going  to be putting in so if we zoom in a  little bit we put the ticker symbol  right here we put the free cash flow  that the company has generated over the  last 12 months in here it's 17 b516  million we put in a terminal growth rate  we'll set this at about2 a half% a  discount rate I feel comfortable with  about 11% this is getting a little bit  riskier especially for a cyclical  company and then we just have to make  these two prices match and we could say  well what about an 18% growth no what  about 20% growth no what about 25%  growth now we're getting closer what  about 28% growth all right so we've got  to just kind of finagle this and what we  see is that today's growth rate pretty  much Nvidia is going to have to 20 27%  growth in its free cash flow every year  for the next 10 years moving forward to  justify today's price and if you look  that means it needs to generate  190 billion dollar in free cash flow 10  years from now in order to justify  today's price look there is no question  that Nvidia hit this out of the park it  is doing everything right but it doesn't  have any real control over what the  market is paying for shares of the  company's stock growing 27% per year it  could certainly grow it at that over the  next couple of years but over 10 years  that is a high hurdle and that in a  nutshell is why Shares are down even  though this report was so positive so  that's just something to keep in mind if  you're buying shares of Nvidia going  forward just know that it is has a lot  of high expectations baked into the  stock there's no question it's a  highquality company but we'll check back  in with this one90 days to see how its  stock looks at that point until then  Brian out\", metadata={'source': '-MOhB2ZoEHw', 'title': \"NVIDIA's Stock

The simple ver‐ sion of ensembles is as follows: 1.Develop a predictive model and record the predictions for a given data set. 2.Repeat for multiple models on the same data. 3.For each record to be predicted, take an average (or a weighted average, or a majority vote) of the predictions.

Set the iteration m= 1. 2.Take a bootstrap resample (i.e., with replacement) of n records from the training data to form a subsample Ym and \\ud835m (the bag). 3.Train a model using Ym and \\ud835m to create a set of decision rules fm\\ud835. 4.Increment the model counter m=m+ 1.
